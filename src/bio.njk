        <h1>Corwin Lee</h1>
        <p>Student, programmer, and somebody who spends way too much time on side projects. Most of who I am lives outside of code though — this page is a peek at that side.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item" data-puzzle-slot="1">
        <h3>A Few Things I Love</h3>
        <p>F1 on Sunday mornings. Arguing about movies at 2 AM. Pickup basketball where nobody keeps score. Finding a random trail and seeing where it goes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item tall image-card" data-puzzle-slot="2" style="background-image: url('https://placehold.co/600x800/e0e0e0/000000?text=Self-Portrait');">
        <div class="card-label">Me, probably</div> 
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item" data-puzzle-slot="3">
        <h3>Just for Fun</h3>
        <p>Sometimes I build stuff just because it sounds fun — like the card counting app I made to see if I could actually learn Hi-Lo. Spoiler: I can, but casinos still scare me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item wide" data-puzzle-slot="4">
        <h3>My Current Hobbies</h3>
        <ul class="skills-list">
            <li><span>Music:</span> Piano since I was a kid, flute since middle school. I'm decent at both, great at neither.</li>
            <li><span>Odd Talents:</span> Sub-minute Rubik's Cube. I've also picked a lock with a paperclip — not for any criminal reason, I promise.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item image-card" data-puzzle-slot="5" style="background-image: url('https://placehold.co/600x400/e0e0e0/000000?text=Outdoors');">
        <div class="card-label">My Natural Habitat</div>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item" data-puzzle-slot="6">
        <h3>Favorite Teams</h3>
        <p>Dallas Mavericks and McLaren F1. My entire mood on any given week is probably correlated with how they did.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item" data-puzzle-slot="7">
        <h3>Past Adventures</h3>
        <p>I went through a parkour phase. It was short. I have the scars to prove both the ambition and the lack of skill.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item wide accent-bg" data-puzzle-slot="8">
        <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
        <p>"If you're not learning something new, you're not paying attention." — me, probably stealing that from someone smarter.</p>
