2022-09-18,TRON: Legacy,2010,https://boxd.it/3eGuSL,4,,"An awesome movie. Just imagine if you had seen those graphics on the big screen. Absolutely amazing. Sure, the plot, screenplay and my connection to the main protagonist had its issues, but the worldbuilding and the effects alone make it worth its while. Oh and I can’t forget about the score. Man, the Daft Punk dudes hit it out of the park. I can only imagine if a 3rd film could have been made.

2022-09-18,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,2021,https://boxd.it/3eGw2R,5,,"Jesus, almost had me in tears from both sides of the spectrum. But first, aesthetics. The visuals lack absolutely nothing, containing astounding colors and cinematography that rival live-action movies. The animation is comparable to that of anime fight scenes and they have those in spades. But the real prize is in the screenplay. We have a simple premise of a world ending but with the comedic elements of the best dark jokes of our generation and the emotional struggle of a teenager. It’s heartwarming in the best fashion. So while the fight scenes and jokes have me crying of laughter, the familial moments have me silently tearing up from sadness and happiness. It truly is a surprising movie to compare to those of Inside Out and Soul.

2022-09-18,The Adam Project,2022,https://boxd.it/3eGwyX,3,,"Standard science fiction movie. Lovable chemistry between all the leads, but the story is a bit stale and visuals, while stunning at times, can also be crappy at times. Love the emotions though. This kid is playing Percy Jackson now and man he’s perfect.

2022-09-18,21 Jump Street,2012,https://boxd.it/3eGxJx,3.5,,"There’s a certain level of comedy where it’s not just a bunch of laughs for hits, but also a lesson is involved and in this film, there was a lesson. The screenplay was masterful. It provided enough depth for our protagonists to sift through. The comedy was exceptional. The emotions hit by this film are heartfelt. We don’t just laugh, we cringe too. The chemistry between all the main characters is amazing to witness and one can only imagine how much fun they must be having. The display of the movie is not exceptional or significant. It’s a simple buddy cop movie, but it does it in the best ways, while also highlighting the stupid tropes that are normally involved in such a movie.
",,
2022-09-18,22 Jump Street,2014,https://boxd.it/3eGzJf,3.5,,"Definitely some callbacks to the last film, comedy level is about the same. Overall, a similar experience to the first movie. I'm not gonna lie the idea that the third movie would've been a crossover between MIB and this buddy cop duo is something I dream of to this day. 
",,
2022-09-18,Star Trek,2009,https://boxd.it/3eGACz,4,,"Amazing start to what can only be assumed to be a franchise rivaling that of Star Wars and Marvel. I would like to mention that maybe too much was set up within this first movie. The first few watches I somehow missed the 3 years later sign which indicates that their entrance into the academy was overlooked. They somehow shoehorned a romance between Spock and Uhura which was definitely not needed. The score though is absolutely amazing and cannot be overlooked. Great movie, can’t wait to see what’s next.
",,
2022-09-18,The Gentlemen,2019,https://boxd.it/3eGBlJ,4,,"Man, I love dialogue. Now maybe, there was a tad too much dialogue and an unnecessary storyline with the Russians was added, but I loved it for its mix of comedy and crime drama. Ritchie’s aesthetic style is nice to see as expected. Guy Ritchie is back to his roots with this piece and definitely is certainly one of my favorites in his selection of movies. 
",,
2022-09-18,Your Name.,2016,https://boxd.it/3eGCTn,4.5,,"Amazing visuals, a heart-wrenching story, amazing score. What else is there to want? I did find the plot too complicated to follow at times (my fault for watching it at 4 AM in the morning), but that didn’t stop my emotions from dripping out of my eyes. Amazing movie.
",,
2022-09-18,Code 8,2019,https://boxd.it/3eGDix,3.5,,"The plot was enough to keep me entertained, though the ending was lackluster and left a lot of questions. The premise and the way they acted on the premise was impressive, from the CGI to the acting. The score was substantial. Overall, entertaining as a flick. Wordbuilding was well done enough for me to want more out of this universe.

2022-09-18,Tenet,2020,https://boxd.it/3eGDOD,3.5,,"It’s a Christopher Nolan film. Amazing visuals and one hell of a confusing story. I consider this one to be one of his worst ones (though that’s not saying anything). My gripes with this story lie simply within the screenplay. While it does introduce this new topic and works around it beautifully, it loses its ability to cohesively tie the story together. We start getting fragments of certain events suddenly jumping forwards and backwards in time without warning. Now that isn’t a bad thing, but with Nolan’s storytelling style, it doesn’t do it any favors. Another gripe I have is the audio. The score, while stimulating, just didn’t seem to fit this movie in the right way. It’s just the general vibe. Also the audio and the speech become meshed together at certain parts, almost entirely muting the dialogue. At one point, I thought that the dialogue wasn’t important until I discovered later that it was. But otherwise, this movie has great rewatch value which is good, because it is definitely one that needs to be rewatched to be understood. 
",,
2022-09-18,Enola Holmes,2020,https://boxd.it/3eGErv,3,,"Set design and visuals do bring a lot to the story. It’s visually intriguing and certainly reminds me of Guy Ritchie’s style. The plot is an issue. It boldly introduces a new plot midway through the story and convincingly forgets the original plot. The characters, while certainly have depth, also have holes in certain story lines. The ending is an entrance for a sequel. It was a decent watch but the script does have its unfortunate moments. Also Henry Cavill. That's all I need to say about him.
",,
2022-09-18,Kimi,2022,https://boxd.it/3eGEYJ,3.5,,"It’s an ode to Hitchcock’s films, specifically Rear Window, except particularly modernized in this film. Great visuals, score, acting, and storyline. All except one gleaming error or series of errors that turned me off for the rest of the film. I’ve got tons of compliments for this film. But I've also got bones to pick with that horrendous third act. Like Hitchcock’s films, we have the mystery set up, then the drawn out clue-searching, and then climactic revelation. Except this film messed up the revelation. Where earlier, we were clued in through details within the script, the third act if anything became a spy movie that held your hand for you to understand the real deal. And even then, it was convoluted and had too many moving parts when it realistically needed little for it to succeed. Still I liked the film, but that third act was abhorrent to watch.
",,
2022-09-18,Birth of the Dragon,2016,https://boxd.it/3eGGuh,3.5,,"Will I say it is accurate? Hell no, cause everyone is arguing whether it is. But it’s entertaining. While the cinematography didn’t remind me of the old HK action movies, the fighting shown was a good mix between the American movies and the HK movies. The plot definitely didn’t serve much. We have what essentially is a Macguffin as the whole plot, but for the most part, it was entertaining if only for the fight scenes and the training. The score was also wonderful to listen to.
",,
2022-09-18,A Rainy Day in New York,2019,https://boxd.it/3eGHbv,2,,"Assholes. That’s how I describe this film. Full of assholes. Every single character is an asshole, except for maybe one and she has at most like 5 minutes of screentime and she spends 4 minutes insulting our asshole protagonist. The visuals were okay. I was more tuned into the jazz background than the movie. I would compare this movie to a book like “The Catcher in the Rye” where it’s a slice of life story. Sure, this one might be a tad bit more extravagant, but the assholes are still there. The story absolutely does not compare though. Chemistry was lacking and if any was there, it was forced. Dialogue was clunky and felt like it was done through a word generator. Actually, most of the film felt like it was done through a drawing in a treasure chest of words. “What happens next? Oh, she hooks up with the director.” The conclusion left me absolutely frazzled. In short, not exactly a great movie. Bearable? Not exactly sure either. 
",,
2022-09-18,Assassin's Creed,2016,https://boxd.it/3eGHLt,3.5,,"I’m not gonna lie. I loved many parts of this movie. The first act of this movie was certainly a bumpy ride for me, but the immersion through the visuals, action sequences, cinematography and set designs (even if computer-generated) was absolutely astonishing. I could nitpick the plot a little bit, but even without former knowledge of the Assassin’s Creed lore, I thoroughly enjoyed the world-building they achieved through this movie, even if somewhat poorly done through. I would’ve preferred if the movie either focused on either the past or the present because there were evidently better ways that the assassin’s creed worldbuilding could’ve been achieved. I will say though, despite the issues I had with the plot, I thoroughly enjoyed the concepts that this movie brought to life through its incredible visuals, score, set design, and action sequences. 
",,
2022-09-18,Edge of Tomorrow,2014,https://boxd.it/3eGJ8X,4,,"This revamps the time travel/war of worlds/robotic suits genre. This movie is easily one of the better science fiction movies out there. While most of our characters are one-dimensional, the premise and concepts this movie presents are thought-provoking and horrifying to see on my laptop screen, much more imaginatively in a movie theater. It definitely identifies more for generic action audiences, but I liked that it took what was a washed up idea and made it anew. ",,
2022-09-18,The Internship,2013,https://boxd.it/3eGKcr,2.5,,"More of a comfort movie, has its moments, but screenplay certainly does have its plot holes. Nothing about its display or cinematography is really astounding (besides its location), but the actors have a decent amount of chemistry despite the forced depth within each of their backgrounds.
",,
2022-09-18,Game Night,2018,https://boxd.it/3eGKFX,4,,"What can I say? In every right of its own, it’s significant. Its screenplay goes all in, barring nothing, shown exceptionally through the twists. The display of all this is nothing to be sighing about either. The cinematography is magnificent, really bringing the “game night” theme into play. The chemistry between each of the individual actors is excellent. Really a great comedy that also contains some amazing camera shots and cinematography. And oh man, I was glued to the screen. Definitely worth rewatching.
",,
2022-09-18,Kodachrome,2017,https://boxd.it/3eGL3v,3,,"Visually, it’s a simple road trip. Now I can’t say it can reach the levels of emotional value as some of the greats, but it certainly does what it intends to do: showcase the struggles of a dying father with regrets and his estranged son. Its got pacing issues and some script writing that leaves more wanted, but it does its job. ",,
2022-09-18,Don Jon,2013,https://boxd.it/3eGLxb,3.5,,"A deeply rich story that is particularly hard to think about. But it’s told in a way that doesn’t force its audience away from the screen. Sure there are moments that are particularly hard to sit through. But the story also draws in emotions unexpectedly. We get an unexpected lesson and it’s heartwarming despite the explicit topic. Visually, it’s not stunning but it also isn’t trashy. There’s a story being told in the way visuals hold up and it’s noticeably there. This movie is one that while I may not rewatch, it is a movie that is worth contemplating. 
",,
2022-09-18,Love and Monsters,2020,https://boxd.it/3eGM1l,4.5,,"I’m still trying to figure out what genre this is because we got the jumpscare horror aspects, the coming of age of teenage fiction, and then the comedic action that only comes from a dystopia. In many ways, this reminds me of Zombieland. We have the protagonist that knows jack shit for survival but survives on purely kindness alone. The lovable side characters that have amazing chemistry. Maybe this story pulled a little pessimism in me as I tried to foretell what was to come. Was I right for some of it? Yeah. But that might be the best part of it. I knew what was coming, but the reaction? Oh there was so much to see. The simple theme was weaved into this amazing journey that while wholly unrealistic, was inspiring to see. The screenplay was a highlight, but the horror has got to be mentioned with the visuals. 
",,
2022-09-18,Spotlight,2015,https://boxd.it/3eGN67,4.5,,"Maybe it started off a little slow, but this movie has a bigger and greater dramatic climax than any action movie. The visuals weren’t flashy. They were just right for a story like this. The focus wasn’t on what we could see but rather what we could feel. The emotions came in waves, each bigger and bigger as more of the plot is revealed. And the score was soft and ominous, underlying the major plot of the story. This movie is heavily dialogue led and rightfully so. Flashbacks wouldn’t have served as much justice as the conversations between each of the characters. There’s no warning for what is to come, only revelations and the movie excels from this. This movie is amazing at what it tells which is a newspaper story. Almost documentary like, you can’t help but be in awe of what was accomplished and the losses that came with it. There’s no black and white in this matter. There is no protagonist and antagonist. It’s simply a story of a group of people who care. And they aren’t perfect either. That might be the best part of the story. It’s about people who care. Absolutely astonishing and mind blowing. 
",,
2022-09-18,Steve Jobs,2015,https://boxd.it/3eGNT9,5,,"There’s something about Sorkin’s writing that always excites me. Maybe it's the real visualization that he embodies the idea of fighting words, but his movies are always driven by dialogue and this dialogue is one of his best, if not the best. Now paired with Danny Boyle, Sorkin’s dialogue is matched with an extensive visual range. The cinematography in this movie is stunning. The visuals that this movie are beautiful and exquisite, matching the speed and the motions of Sorkin’s dialogue. Fassbender’s acting is perfectly showcasing the intensity of the script. The score also perfectly complements the film’s editing to an amazing degree. Masterful movie in every aspect. 
",,
2022-09-18,Top Gun,1986,https://boxd.it/3eGPTF,3,,"For what it is, it certainly does it well. It contains all the hallmarks of a good action flick. The screenplay could use some work, but the action and cinematography certainly makes up for any lost feelings. This movie tugs on the heartstrings a bit and pulls off what is the most recognizable action flick of the 20th century. 
",,
2022-09-18,Top Gun: Maverick,2022,https://boxd.it/3eGRgv,4.5,,"Amazing theater experience. There’s no other way of explaining it. You find yourself not just experiencing the nostalgia of the old being fulfilled but also the sight of a new generation closing the story. The cinematography is amazing with all its practical glory. The acting is phenomenal with Val Kilmerdespite his lack of a voice. The story was also masterful in pulling on the heartstrings, of course it has its holes mainly the du ex machina at the end and the lack of depth on much of the new generation but as a whole, this movie serves not just as a sequel that exemplifies the action of the first movie, but also a worthy movie in itself. Also the score was also in part by Hans Zimmer. Unexpected gift. 
",,
2022-09-18,Big Hero 6,2014,https://boxd.it/3eGRJx,4,,"This movie is a favorite of mine. It deals with loss in a masterful way while seemingly unrealistics in “San Fransokyo”, but realistic in aspect. Its world building is slightly lackluster but the movement of the plot is one that tugs at my emotions greatly. I feel old watching this in 2022.
",,
2022-09-18,Tropic Thunder,2008,https://boxd.it/3eGThv,3.5,,"How do I describe this movie? Film-ception? A film that might be even better when you’re drunk or high? In many ways, I feel like the entire movie is improvised. Forget all the special explosions and weird set designs. This whole script could be improvised and honestly I wouldn’t be surprised. All in a good way. This movie had be bursting with laughter with all the random cameos and then the absolute bonkers storyline. In reality, I'm expecting the script to be very simple. But the ability of the stars to absolutely squeeze every comedic juice out of its plot is nothing short of hilarious insanity. 
",,
2022-09-18,The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,2015,https://boxd.it/3eGTN7,4.5,,"Amazing acting from all parties, great visuals, not spectacular, but certainly not generic. Set design is exquisite. Plot was wonderful to follow if not simple at times. Guy Ritchie brings his unique style to the world of spies and does so perfectly, especially with such star-studded cast. The chemistry was wonderful and dynamic and was unique. Oh, and the score is absolutely astounding to listen to along with the visuals. 
",,
2022-09-18,Columbus,2017,https://boxd.it/3eGUm7,4.5,,"After a rewatch, the main theme appears to me. Sure, this movie is forcibly slow. Slower than even “Spotlight” because there’s no real climactic action. But the story revolves on this axis of parallels from both the visuals and the story. Visually, we are getting these amazing photographic pieces of nature and architecture. Kogonoda (the director) isn’t much for moving cinematography, but more preferable of the still life that the city provides through simple yet beautiful images. These images repeat but with different perspectives as the stories move along. These parallels are subtle but are crucial to the story. The parallels also play in the dialogue as well, despite the small amount it has. To state it simply, the story begins with one character on the move and one staying and the story ends with one character on the move and one staying. Parallels drive this movie forward subtly. Subtlety is the characteristic that this movie uses and it does so beautifully and amazingly. There’s so many amazing aspects to this movie that I can’t fit it all. But this movie is for sure a masterpiece. ",,
2022-09-18,The Gray Man,2022,https://boxd.it/3eGUGB,3,,"Mainly plot issues, camera movements, and edits that could have used some work, but otherwise, a thrilling action movie that I’d gladly watch the sequel to. Acting was alright and seeing Chris Evans in a villain role was not something I expected to have absolutely loved in this movie. 
",,
2022-09-18,Bullet Train,2022,https://boxd.it/3eGVfB,3.5,,"Definitely a very fun movie! The action and choreography was well done. The visuals looked very colorful for Japan. Some fun cameos and nice comedic timing. One thing I do gripe about is the absolute padding in time they pulled off with the unreasonable amount of exposition. Look, I love how this movie is connected at every piece of the puzzle. In many ways, I consider this a comedic portrayal of Kenneth Branagh’s “Murder on the Orient Express” but the amount of flashbacks and repetition of the same flashbacks just to highlight a side character who lasts about 5 minutes max of the movie took up an illogical amount of this movie. But despite this, it’s fun seeing that no matter how much each character gripes about fate and luck, in the end, they found themselves there because of what they did and not because of fate. Man, even the actors seemed to have fun playing their characters and there was undeniable chemistry between them all even the hateable little girl. Overall, fun action movie with nice views and great acting though I wouldn’t recommend thinking too hard over it. 
",,
2022-09-18,The Lost City,2022,https://boxd.it/3eGVCl,3.5,,"In many ways, it’s a generic adventure-comedy film. But it has better chemistry within its protagonists than some movies out there and it has witty moments that I can't help but repeat. I enjoyed it. It’s as simple as that. Also, the score really surprised me, really elevated the film for me",,
2022-09-18,6 Underground,2019,https://boxd.it/3eGVTr,2.5,,"Despite all the hatred for Michael Bay’s “artistry” in the film medium, if there’s something I must credit him for, it’s his ability to capture absolute unreal shots during high-pressure action sequences in the middle of creatively abundant action sets. He’s just amazing at it and I can’t help but look in awe at the visuals displayed. The edits and cuts were disorientating at times but overall, the visuals were top notch as expected. Now the story on the other hand. The story had some promise I must say. It had some promise. Then I had no idea where it was going or even if I was looking at the present. But my main hitch with the movie was the absolutely unneeded comedy. There’s a deviation in tone within the first ten minutes of the movie and it keeps unraveling every time we get a joke because I feel as a part of an audience that there was a tone that Bay was going for but then the story shoehorned in a joke for some reason and then we lost that tone. To end on a positive note though, the score was actually pretty decent.  
",,
2022-09-18,Inglourious Basterds,2009,https://boxd.it/3eGWlv,4,,"This is a western film. Simple as that. Add on some great set pieces, amazing acting, a tad too much gore in my opinion, and this is key for Tarantino. I’m not going to lie. Am I a fan of him changing history? No. Was I entertained for the entirety of this film. Hell yeah. The cinematography was great. The script was bare minimum in my fair opinion. It’s realistically a simple story. Just add in 4 or 5 elements of surprise and you got yourself this film. While not entirely sure why I classified it as a western, there are certain elements that ensure my choice of its permanence in that region. It’s entire gray morality that everyone that served as the “good” side held and the absolute hatred that was acted masterfully by anyone with a Nazi symbol. And with a simple story like that, this is why I think it’s a great western.
",,
2022-09-18,The End of the Tour,2015,https://boxd.it/3eGWOn,3.5,,"You can see where this movie was based on the memoir that David Lipsky wrote. The movie’s quality and value isn’t placed on the rather bland visuals but the screenplay and story. The dialogue evoked the great acting produced by both Eisenberg and Segel. Ultimately, in my mind, I feel that (after only watching the movie) I would’ve preferred the book because the storyline would move much smoother in a book format. But the movie does a great job pushing forward emotion and pathos. It forces us to think about successes and how we value them and the duality of life itself. Also the score by Danny Elfman perfectly compliments this movie. 
",,
2022-09-18,DC League of Super-Pets,2022,https://boxd.it/3eGX3R,3,,"This movie made me wonder if only The Rock put as much acting into his physicality as much as his voice. I’m not asking for him to lose or gain weight like Christian Bale per say, but the voice acting in this movie was (if not cliche) well done. It does get sorta boring listening to the same actors voice act, but in this movie, it was well done. The comedy was on point, if not crude at some points. The animation was ropey for the first half. It wasn’t necessarily bad, just unoriginal, until the final fight scenes which showed some great animation surprisingly. I had a few laughs and that’s alright. There were definitely some parts which I believe the phrase “suspension of belief” was remarkably needed, but as a whole, the movie was entertaining, taught a nice lesson and catered to children wonderfully, despite the crude humor.

2022-09-26,Jujutsu Kaisen 0,2021,https://boxd.it/3gi9Wn,4,,"It’s a great prequel. It’s perfect for those who haven’t watched the show. But it’s also services itself for those who have watched the show. It has beautiful animations, glorious fight scenes, and the score, oh what else can I say about the music besides it perfectly supplementing the animation. The story itself, while it does indeed tug on the emotions a little bit, feels slightly overstuffed. We don’t get the depth that the story should put on certain characters or certain events. It’s still an amazing arc to follow in this universe, but the story could’ve used a little more work. I'm most definitely still waiting for season 2 and hopefully Yuta appears :)

2022-09-28,Set It Up,2018,https://boxd.it/3gyJpL,3.5,,"It’s the same story every time. The wingman tries to set up their friend/boss/employee/(other person that’s either an ass or really crappy with romance). The difference is usually the time period or setting. And it usually ends the same. The wingman falls for another. But these days, you don’t really get rom coms like these anymore. They are deemed too generic or cookie cutter. They usually aren’t wrong. Which would be why most of them end up on Netflix Originals. But this film is different. No, it’s not different in the way where we actually have adults playing adults and not highschoolers as per the usual of Netflix Originals. We have a script that bleeds comedy and emotion. We have chemistry! Now this ain’t the best rom com I’ve ever seen. It has a very fairytale-like score. It has surprisingly decent visuals. Nothing that really shouts “Amazing!” from the rooftops, but its simplicity proposes that even in a time where superhero movies reign in the theaters, simple rom coms can still thrive if injected with just the right cast and script. Also Glen Powell is the only reason I watched this film in the first place, so I’m happy I got a lot more out of it.

2022-10-16,Ted,2012,https://boxd.it/3kvGGz,3.5,,"It’s a comedy film that somehow combines the theme of Hop (remember that movie? I certainly didn’t up till now) and the storyline of a sitcom episode. Thoroughly enjoyable for absolutely no reason besides the fact I find the premise of this entire movie absolutely unbelievably astounding. Honestly I was wondering if I could have convinced my parents to let me see this rated R movie in theaters. I think I could’ve.

2022-11-11,Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,2022,https://boxd.it/3q0Uaf,3.5,,"I would rather put this movie into the drama genre than the comic book genre. Of course, the premise of water gods and superhuman technology is nothing short of comic book related, but the entirety of the movie doesn’t revolve around that fictional quality unlike most of the MCU’s storylines. What we have (dumbed down) is essentially the passing on of a crown and how they as a person conflict with that passing. It has beautiful moments in it as we see Shuri deal with the understanding. What didn't work was the rest of it. The third act was easily the best part of the movie. It had the best part of the score (which is saying something since the first movie had a terrific score all around), best cinematography, best part of the script, best action etc. But even then, the best act was still lacking without even talking about the rest of the movie. There has to be understanding that this story was not one that wanted to be told. Imagine having to reverse engineer a story to ensure it fits the mold of the MCU but also works around the loss of one of its most important characters. Ryan Coogler, the cast, and all who worked on the movie did wonderfully with what they had. If anything, it gave a terrific tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman and a wonderful entrance to Namor or Kukulkan. I liked this movie for the emotions that it drove, but it’s without a doubt flawed in some places. Still, definitely worth the theater experience as the audience also felt that grief flow from the movie to them.

2022-11-16,The Big Short,2015,https://boxd.it/3r9Ra9,4,,"It’s a tragedy. From beginning to the end. Mckay exemplifies that and states that from the beginning. What we’re left with should evidently be dramatic irony. But at some point, we as an audience forget that. We forget all about the 2008 stock market crash as we watch 3 different protagonists fight for their goal. Despite being based on real people, there’s a certain archetype that each of our protagonists fit. Baum fits the stereotype of a broken man looking for every fault in the system. Not only does he find a fault, but he finds the biggest fault in the economy. He then proceeds to exploit it to his own dismay. His story is a tragedy. Burry is a man looking to get the best outcome for others. He was the earliest to foresee the end of the financial world. Yet, the people that once trusted him turned their backs to him blindly. In the end, he finds his lucrative prize that he waited so long for, but to him, it was at the cost of every relationship. His story is a tragedy. Charlie and Jamie are two boys looking out for themselves. They were the latest, but they had help from Richert, but even then, they didn’t understand what they had betted on until Richert forced them to see. Their story turns out to be a tragedy as well in the end. Adam Mckay tells a hilarious and brilliant social commentary and Greek tragedy of what was one of the worst times in the world. Sure, the cast felt unbalanced especially with Ryan Gosling as a pseudo-narrator and Brad Pitt as a very minor character. The cuts were jolting at times and if anything, uninspirational, but the story was nothing short of riveting. In short, a story about the world’s most forgettable tragedy.

2022-12-22,Tag,2018,https://boxd.it/3yXFAn,3,Yes,"Some movies like “The End of the Tour” are better as books. I consider this to be one of them. Sure, seeing Ed Helm, Jon Hamm, Jake Johnson, Jeremy Renner, and Hannibal on screen playing tag as a movie was entertaining, but it lacked something that connected all the individual events together. The chemistry and theatrics were all there. The use of the perspective with Johnson’s introduction into the movie was the only really stimulating scene besides all the slo-mo action, but the story was lacking. The beginning felt like it was rushed to get to the main plotline which even then wasn’t as captivating as expected. The chemistry was glowing through the screen whether it was the quips or the emotions, you could tell that the actors had fun with the movie. But the script felt rushed and what could’ve been a very emotionally stimulating movie became a comedy for an hour and 45 minutes with the last 5 minutes being the only emotional part of it. Overall though, I enjoyed the chemistry a lot. The movie was entertaining, definitely worth a watch on a random night if nothing else is on.

Set in a classic whodunit mystery genre, dramatic irony is unleashed in the very start to lead the audience on a false trail. We feel that we know everything yet at the same time, we don’t. Paired with flawless acting from our star-studded cast, from the “country” accent drawl of Daniel Craig (I can’t even see James Bond anymore) to the fear that we can see in Ana De Armas’s eyes to even the posh rich asshole in Chris Evans, we’re pleasantly surprised by the twist in the end and the reveal is all the more satisfying for it. The screenplay is tight, covering every plot hole. The audience is led on for 95% of the movie successfully without fail. Like Aaron Sorkin with his clashing dialogue, Rian Johnson crafts a mystery classic for decades to come. Oh and the score is exciting and riveting, perfectly adapting to the timeless period that this story is set in. Can’t wait for the next adventures of Benoit Blanc.

The constant air of suspense in the first one is lacking in this one. The script was more compelling and filled in the first one. But this one in its own right, is good as well. Not quite a masterpiece like the first, but a good follow up. I was definitely still riveted by the mystery at hand, but the twist just didn’t hit as well in this film as compared to the first. Still, I’m imagining a mystery genre movie series like the Hercule Poirot mystery series of Agatha Christie and we got past the old treasured mansion and private island mystery stories.

So let’s just say I spent the first 20 minutes being reacquainted to the old characters and the new. Still left plenty of time to get invested in the plot because of the 3 hour runtime. All jokes aside from this “long-awaited” sequel of the decade, it was a technically beautiful film. Marvel’s Namor and the former DCEU’s Aquaman are miles behind in worldbuilding as James Cameron crafts whole species, civilizations, and cultures. The actors and actresses that are in this film act with passion and force and it’s evident even through the CGI. The story is full of emotions. It’s also somewhat tropey, but it’s a new blend in my opinion. What I do have an issue with is 2 things: The kids in the movie are the blame for quite literally everything that has happened from start to end and second, I don’t know most of the character’s names in the movie. Now I was emotionally invested in this movie, there were many parts that had my heart on strings, but our introduction to these characters were short if anything. They were not without depth such as No’ak (if I’m spelling his name right), but others, like his brother, were lacking in character. From my knowledge after watching the movie, I only remembered his brother’s name after his final scene. Still, it’s a very well-crafted movie from a technical perspective and I definitely need to rewatch the first movie. Also, I really loved the orchestral score of this movie. It really brought out the beauty of the sea but also the horror of war.

There’s so much to love about this movie from its animation to its characters. I remember absolutely nothing from the first movie besides the egg’s betrayal, but the storyline in this movie absolutely hits all the strings from the comedic value to the emotional heart strings. We have loveable characters from all sides (besides whatever fairytale Jack Horner came from) and they all have emotional backstories that make us swoon in their favor. Sure, some backstories were a little short, but it didn’t stop me from nearly tearing up at that conclusion of all their stories. The voice acting is nothing short of masterful from the wolf’s revelations to Puss’s swagger. And that animation? Oh, that animation has been a trend within the last few years, but it only works well when paired with amazing action sequences and with Puss in Boots, that’s never a shortage. I love this story from beginning to end because it has an amazing story with solid pacing, colorful animation, and acting that gets even me scared at times.

But I can still admire the quality of the movie. Riveting action-comedy? Depressing character study? Perspective-filling family drama? Beautiful science fiction adventure? Most movies can barely achieve one, much less all of these genres in the span of 2 hours and with a budget a quarter that of major blockbusters. Yet it does it. While achieving 11 nominations at the Oscars. And they are all very well deserved. This might be Michelle Yeoh’s best performance. Despite me not being as into the movie as I could be, her ability to draw my emotions to the surface is an absolute masterclass. Stephanie Hsu acts her heart out as a depressed daughter failing her mother’s expectations. I absolutely loved her performance (and even saw some of myself in her story). Ke Huy Quan’s character has no real character arc. He’s the same bumbling optimistic character but his optimism is downright infectious. All of these actors, for the record, acted multiple parts. We have Jobu Topaki, Alpha Wong, and the dozen versions of Evelyn Quan we see. The actors couldn’t have acted with this much finesse without an amazing screenplay behind them. And it’s one amazing screenplay filled with not only amazing dialogue but also movie direction. Now to the cinematography. Beautiful. This applies to both the smooth choreographed action sequences and the whole multiverse concept from the CGI sets to even the rock scene. Even now, I think the coolest scene is the scene where Jobu Topaki first enters Evelyn’s universe with her finger acting like a clock, terrifying edits there. The musical score in this movie travels the multiverse as well and it was so fitting in this movie. There’s so much more I want to say, but final comment? I honestly wanna see this movie either high or drunk just to see if I’ll like it more.

Imagine if Star Wars was copy and pasted with Marvel characters. I kid you not, I spent half my time counting the similarities between any given Star Wars film and this film. I’ll give it points for the good parts of the CGI, but even then there were some parts where I thought I was watching Sharkboy and Lavagirl all over again. (Hint, there was a point where I had flashbacks to the Star War Council scenes) Even if we move away from the unfortunate and innumerable amount of similarities to other cinematic universes, the plotline is a how-to guide on what not to do in a movie. We have no realistic Act 1 in the story. We have tropes on tropes. We have no arc, whether that be a training or character arc. This movie somehow managed to fit 2 du ex machinas’ which I thought was impossible. Impossible, I tell you. Not to mention the one-off character that has no reason to exist. I will give some due credit to the comedy, which I could argue might be incidental because of the terrible writing, but in the theater, it created lots of laughs. In all honesty, I would watch this for its introduction to Kang. Otherwise, I wish Luis from the past Antman movies could explain it to me in 30 seconds.

I felt emotional tension at times, despite not being fully into the movie. But, I feel like there were too many subplots that connected to the main plot.

This movie wraps around the idea that Hiccup is learning what it means to be chief and that he needs to do what’s best for his people. Dragons included. It hurt to see Hiccup’s face as he understands the thing he must do for the best of everyone. The pacing in this movie is somewhat off, but nothing too pushing. I would’ve rated this lower, but that last scene of Hiccup seeing his old friend with his whole family is just so heartwarming.

This time, it exploded. Why was that? Was it the fact that this rom com, while simple at best, showed the Asians could have acted many times where a white actor did? Where even if you traded out all the white actors in a rom com with Asian actors, they could do it too? That’s what makes this movie great. It shows that I can see people who look like me on screen instead of seeing Scott Eastwood for what seems like his tenth rom com. Now to the movie itself. The story was simple, but the accessories were less so. Even then, the story had a very strong third act. It had one of the best wedding sequences I’ve seen. Flamboyant fashion and set designs. Amazing choreographed scenes that held meaning so not just for show. An amazing soundtrack where if you listen deep enough were either Asian singers covering popular songs in their own languages. Each piece, all inspired by Asian culture. I will complain about this movie for one thing. Astrid’s subplot of a cheating husband went nowhere. It held no purpose. Probably the only thing to not hold any purpose in the movie surprisingly. But otherwise, a great movie that pushes forward a wonderful idea. Though I do wish John Cho was in it.

Up until now, I don’t think I’ve ever realized how hard survivor’s guilt must be for the survivor, but this movie perfectly encapsulates the emotions that come with it, as well as the pain. This movie was excellent in so many different ways. The acting from Josh Brolin, Jennifer Connelly, and Miles Teller was raw, visceral, and all too authentic. The music was reminiscent of director Joseph Kosinski’s debut “Tron Legacy”. Kosinski’ direction of the movie reminds me of Taylor Sheridan’s work, especially the beauty that they both depict in nature and how they frame the surroundings of our protagonists whether it be the flame that burn through the brush of California or the light show that is Tron legacy. My only nitpick of the movie is that the story, while well-written emotionally, felt somewhat empty of more bonding scenes. One of the most memorable scenes to me is when Mac and Brendan have his daughter over for the first time and their interactions show their growth into friends and I wish there was more of that.

The animation is colorful and dynamic. And the worldbuilding blends it all together into something I could realistically believe in. But what hits the most is the message embedded deep within the emotional depths of this story. Each guardian embodies a “center” and this existential philosophy drives our protagonist forward in his own search to discover his purpose. The voice acting is brilliant and perfect in my eyes. And all of these aspects drive forward a movie that should’ve deserving of an Oscar or in the least, a sequel. Yet it isn’t. It’s a forgotten gem of the past ironically in the sense of the movie.

Even then, it still deserves an absurdly high score for what it is. The animations are a visual delicacy (I especially loved Gwen’s water-coloresque animation from her world) for the eyes. The contrasts between different worlds seen through animation is an idea worthy of an Oscar not the mention the actual sweat and tears into making it happen, from Hobie’s paper-mache?(not sure how to describe it, but it’s newspaper) cutouts to Earth 42’s dark, gothic take on New York. So many dynamic shots that fly through the screen and even then the static shots might just be my favorite. All the visuals were there, but how about the story? Whereas the first story formed the motivation and ideals for Miles, this story challenges him on those ideals. Compared to the first one, the story pushes what might be too much, then again, it also might be because there’s a third movie coming. But the first movie does push the story better. Again, Daniel Pemberton is a musical genius, not just reusing the themes from the first movie but refreshing on them in a new light as well as placing absolute bangers for our new characters as well (Miguel’s theme is an earworm for right now).

2023-07-21,Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief,2010,https://boxd.it/4y2fEH,3,Yes,"Look, it’s a shit film adaptation. It’s got nothing in common with the book besides its name. But it’s still an entertaining movie if we ignore that it is a film adaptation. The casting was alright. Honestly, I’d rather see Grover like this than how he was in the books. Logan Lerman would be the perfect Percy Jackson… if he wasn’t 18 years old or whatever he is in the movie. The script wasn’t too great, but it was serviceable. I liked the music and the visuals. I’m a huge fan of the books but honestly, this movie wasn’t too bad. Sure, it ain’t exactly the book, but it’s still pretty entertaining. ",,2023-07-20
2023-07-26,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,2017,https://boxd.it/4AmlxZ,3.5,Yes,"It’s Guy Ritchie’s version of the legend of King Arthur. While it might not be the best at telling it, it sure is damn well entertaining. Ritchie’s iconic style for telling stories is littered throughout this classic tale from the quick editing and flashback storytelling to the slow motion cinematography and incredible set designs. I will say that the CGI at certain points was over the top and the screenplay was very shallow. But this epic legend deserved a new visual rendition and Ritchie was the perfect director to do it. While it did feel rushed, the pacing and editing combined with the iconic Ritchie’s visual creations made this a very fun and honestly new take on what is a very old and repeated story. I honestly think the critics are very wrong about this movie, like there were some bad parts, but not 22% Rotten Tomatoes bad. I would like to see a sequel to flesh out the story and continue Charlie Hunnam’s dark yet positive rendition of Arthur Pendragon, but it’s very likely a standalone movie. Oh and Daniel Pemberton's masterpiece of a score might genuinely be one of my favorites of all time. ",,2023-07-25
2023-07-28,Oppenheimer,2023,https://boxd.it/4BdwlV,4,,"For once, Christopher Nolan isn’t relying on action-filled story that comes upon twists and turns, confusing the audience again and again leading to the ending. This film is a narrative film that all of us know the ending to. We know the results of Oppenheimer’s experiments and the devastation it causes. The hell on Earth created in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Focusing on Oppenheimer’s past, present, and future, Christopher Nolan crafts a suspenseful, stressful film, elevated to an even higher standard with Cillian Murphy’s incredible acting and Nolan’s visual genius. In it, we follow Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer or “Oppie” from his Cambridge days, where he dreamt of quantum physics to the point of depression and obsession, to his awarded moments as an old man on the carpet floor of the White House as a Cabinet Member. To describe this movie in short, it is the Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame of scientists. Through a star-studded cast, we come to know Oppenheimer’s genius intellect teammates that helped him build this devastating invention. And several stars shine through this cast such as Robert Downey Jr.’s tragic take on Lewis Strauss as well as Emily Blunt’s supportive but forceful take on Kitty Oppenheimer. The story weaves an incredible tale of a positive rise, triumph, and fall from grace even with some notes of mystery in there. The first act was the weakest in my opinion, the disordered timeline was confusing without context, the second act proved more solid with a steadier time switching between Oppenheimer’s charges and his project’s rise. The third act was the strongest as we see the fall of Oppenheimer intertwined with Strauss’s betrayal. The story even had an effect on the music, Ludwig Gorannson’s rise as a composer is nothing short of extraordinary and paired with Nolan’s writing, it worked well. Now for me the strongest was the visuals. Interspersed between exposition scenes or tumultuous scenes, Nolan’s visualization of the atomic bomb in both a microscopic scale for quantum physics as well as the effects of it is nothing short of visually stimulating. Even the landscape scenes of New Mexico are frightening, focusing in on the barren landscape devoid of life. All in all, it was a different type of story from genius director Christopher Nolan, and I hope he continues to do more of these, reinvigorating history in motion.

2023-08-18,The Prestige,2006,https://boxd.it/4Ino8x,4.5,,"One of Christopher Nolan’s earlier films and a tiny seed of what he was capable of, just the pledge to what we see today. Forget all the visual effects and amazing musical scores of Oppenheimer, Tenet, or even Inception. Nolan’s strongest aspect has always been his screenplay. His storytelling has always been spectacular and in this film where we’re not bombarded with amazing visuals and strong music, we see it shine in full. Despite knowing the solution or the secret if you will, I still couldn’t see the twist coming. My eyes were glued to the silver screen, watching as Angier indulges in his obsessions and Borden watches his life burn because of his divisiveness. Of course, the movie itself wouldn’t be good without its actors and Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale serve as wonderful pawns on Nolan’s board. Jackman’s distress is raw and frightening while Bale’s calm yet cold exterior somehow mirrors his inner turmoil as well. Without spoiling, their acting is masterful in more ways than one. I fully believe that this is one of Nolan’s best films. Because it showcased what he did best: telling a story in ways no other director can. ",,2023-08-17
2023-08-20,Dead Poets Society,1989,https://boxd.it/4J0Ic3,4,,"To me, this is the antithesis to Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. As much as you can run away from the expectations of life, at one point, it will come barrelling downhill whether you like it or not. This film is tragic, while it does show the boys growing under the tutelage of the late Robin Williams’ masterful characterization of the zealous teacher Mr. Keating, it also shows the consequences that come with ‘riling up chaos against authority’. One thing that caught up to me was the scenes leading up to Neil Perry’s death. We thought we understood the stress he undertook, but as the scene darkens and the sound dies out, we finally see how his unhealthy relationship with his parents took a toll on his well being despite Mr. Keating’s attempts to help him. The pressure was there from the beginning, but the result was unexpected and tragic. The acting was brilliant from all sides. The screenplay, while a tad bit slow on pacing and slightly lacking in depth, held much emotion and crafted a third act that threw my emotions in a mixer. I can see why this movie has become a cultural icon. This movie showed a generation how to rise up against authority and seize the day. Carpe Diem!",,2023-08-19
2023-08-23,Good Will Hunting,1997,https://boxd.it/4K0bgl,4.5,,"I’m gonna start off with the fact that this is the closest thing to authentic dialogue I have seen in a movie. I might love Aaron Sorkin’s or Tarantino’s smart and snappy dialogue, but this movie shows how normal people will talk. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both deservedly earned the Oscar for best screenplay this year without a doubt. Now to the movie itself. This is my first time seeing this movie and I’ve heard this movie talked about so many times, but none of that does it justice. The idea of potential in life is a challenging topic to think about much less write about yet this movie perfectly encapsulates how different people view potential. Will Hunting, our protagonist, has an incredible gift. Literally everyone else in this movie is trying to help him. He just doesn’t want it. The interesting thing to me is how each goes about to help him. Professor Lambeau sees how high his potential could be and thinks that by pushing Will, he could reach it. Robin Williams’ Sean Maguire believes in letting Will choose his fate and simply guiding him towards understanding his choices. Every character is doing their best to help him in this journey but Will doesn’t want to move. He’s not content with where he is exactly, but he’s safe. This movie is an exploration between reaching potential and breaching your comfort zone. The story is spectacular and very much approachable even if we’re not geniuses. I love the acting too in this movie. My favorite scene is where Will introduces his girlfriend to his friend group and they are sitting at the bar they usually go to. The dialogue from that scene is realistic to how an actual friend group would talk, shit housing their way with stories and jokes. Matt Damon’s Will Hunting is a masterclass in both dynamic and subtle acting just like Robin Williams. This movie is just a masterpiece in general, though I do wish I had some more time learning about the relationship between Lambeau and Maguire in depth. Just a great movie.

2023-08-28,Barbie,2023,https://boxd.it/4LwUqt,4,,"Barbie is one of the most recognizable brands in the world and it’s only fitting that this movie would become one of the highest trending movies of this year. Example: The movie theater I was in was packed to the brim even after 2 months of the movie being out. Now to the review. This movie was incredibly well directed and well made. Everything from the set design to the action choreography was fluid and fitting in this movie. To push all this through is a well-written screenplay by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Tied together by an incredible theme, the screenplay produces hilarious comedic timing and turbulent emotional turmoil while guiding the audience into understanding important philosophies throughout this movie. Simu Liu was a standout with his comedy just like Ryan Gosling’s surprisingly masterful take on Ken (whoever said he couldn’t do it… like what were you thinking) Margot Robbie was, of course, exceptional as the iconic (“stereotypical”) Barbie. And of course, the songs and score that was heard throughout the movie have become iconic in their own right. All in all, it’s an incredibly well-made movie connected with a modern lesson. Personally, the story was shallow, not in the way of the theme, but in the movement of the plot, leading to what I felt was a fast-paced movie. I would’ve loved for just a tad bit more depth for a lot of characters. But even then, Barbie is an excellent movie for modern society.

I went into this movie thinking this is Avatar and the Last Airbender mixed with Zootopia. On the hand, this movie is so incredibly cute and romantic, one of the most romantic Disney/Pixar films in quite a while! I absolutely adored the chemistry and relationship between Wade and Ember. In this story, they were also a vessel for a larger story of immigrant culture and the pains that first and second-generation immigrants go through trying to achieve their individual dreams and it is so well-written in tackling this modern theme in a way where you feel the emotional impact and stress these families place on one another. This movie is a romantic comedy, filled with its tropes and surprisingly a few rather adult jokes that flew by no one’s head with the friends I watched it with, though sometimes it spends more time “telling than showing”. I adored everything about it, from the dazzling visuals that are a fresh take off of what people have been complaining about the “Pixar look” to the Thomas Newman score (a pleasant surprise when I saw his name pop up!) Forget whatever the reviewers were on, Rotten Tomatoes has got this movie absolutely wrong, it might not be the typical deep existential story that Pixar is known for, but this romantic comedy isn’t one to miss

2024-01-02,The Truman Show,1998,https://boxd.it/5t6QBh,5,Yes,"24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Live streamed to the entire world for 30 years. Truman’s entire life. The Truman Show is a movie based around one thing. Truman. Jim Carrey acts as our protagonist and is amazing at it, arguably one of, if not, his best performances as an actor. His naivety and innocence is so believable but as his world crashes around him, Truman’s insanity at the situation, yet undeniable will is just as powerful. Jim Carrey should’ve deserved an Oscar nomination for such incredible range, but no matter. This world is crafted to perfection by Director Peter Weir, from set design to script. From the moment the movie begins, we see the world through the eyes of the audience. The Truman Show’s audience. Every perspective for nearly the whole movie is from the audience’s point of view, whether that be the use of the fisheye lens for close up camera shots hidden away from Truman or the overlay of the radio screen to show the hidden lens watching Truman drive. We see the world not through Truman’s unknowing innocence but from the dramatic irony of the audience. In many ways, this movie world builds through the different perspectives because at the same time, as we understand Truman’s fake world, so does he. We only get the behind-the-scenes or the outside world at all as Truman also devolves from his innocence. We stop with the hidden cameras and see Christof, his creator, and the history that lies behind Truman. Peter Weir was clever enough to build his world using the audience’s view that we can follow Truman’s fracturing ideals when discovering his plight. This ending is rather poignant as well as we watch Truman walk through an exit door without looking back and not knowing what’s in it. And the movie ends there. I’m not a big fan of movies that end on empty notes, but in Truman’s case, it works. In the story, for 30 years, he’s been under a camera, if not a microscope essentially, and to end it not knowing what happened, is the perfect scenario for Truman. Man, I love this movie.",,2024-01-01
2024-01-04,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,2021,https://boxd.it/5u8sIB,3.5,Yes,"Considered the start to a new era of Marvel movies, Shang-Chi certainly bodes well for the future. With fantastic visuals with a compelling origin story, Shang-Chi is sure to be a staple in this new stage. The fight scenes were some of, if not the best, in the MCU. Choreographed into reality, we aren’t getting fast edits (though there were a few of those) but singular takes of fights, reminiscent to that of Chinese films of old. Oh and I especially loved how they integrated East Asian culture in the story as well as set and costume designs. Tony Leung acted masterfully, crafting one of the most memorable villains in a universe filled with many. The soundtrack as well is quite catchy.

Of course, I expected all of that from Pete Docter, one of the all-time greats in animation. But this film hit me right into an existential crisis. The message in this film is “the spark to living isn’t the purpose to live but rather the reason to live.” It’s a hard-hitting idea as is the movie from beginning to end. Of course, there’s so many good quotes that come from this film. Dorothea William’s metaphor about the fish in the ocean, for example, is one that encapsulates the message all too well. The dialogue feels natural and real, the story simple yet rich with complex ideas in its depth. Oh and don’t get me started on the animation. I loved the animation of the “Great Before” with its soft watercolor tones and simple geometric lines. The music is amazing from what I think is the synthesizer in the hypothetical worlds to the jazz that Joe Gardner lives for. Pete Docter hit it out of the park once again and honestly, might be one of his best. I do just wish we got to understand more of the lost souls, I really think Moonwind’s quote about obsession to a purpose leading to becoming a lost soul is one of the most impactful lines.

If you’re gonna change the name, love at first sight is the most generic name that could’ve possibly been on the table.

2024-01-22,The Edge of Seventeen,2016,https://boxd.it/5ENvs9,4,Yes,"In life, there are no enemies. Unless you really wanna consider that random idiot from middle school your nemesis. Sure, there are challenges and obstacles, but that’s the point of life, to grow past them, rise above them, and learn from them. That’s the ideal goal at least. Sometimes, we get stuck to a point where we just sit and take the heat instead. Just so low to the point where you can’t even hate yourself anymore and just blame everything around you, even those who do their best to support you. This movie revolves around that point. In this movie, the dialogue is so organic and relatable from its sarcasm and dry humor to the rants that the characters in this movie go on. The humor isn’t awkward or mistimed and the rants are heartfelt and genuine. The characters themselves have so much depth that each one despite the huge differential is screen time. Nadine, our protagonist who is wonderfully acted out by Hailee Steinfeld, is infuriating to say the least and her character arc is nothing short of realism that I could see in myself as well just a few years back. Her brother played by Blake Jenner is also a highlight in this movie with the generational chasm that separates Nadine and himself. Woody Harrelson plays the sarcastic teacher who quietly guides Nadine in her troubles, though I do wish we had more screen time between the pair of them to better flourish their relationship. In short, this movie could very well be a documentary on the hardest parts of growing up and it belongs on a shelf of its own in a genre that has many greats.

An A-plus cast led by the ever so charming George Clooney and Brad Pitt, excellent and quick editing that is signature in Soderbergh movies, and a crafty story that perfectly adheres to the quick editing, Ocean’s 11 is a wonderful crime movie and is just as good as a movie as any of the Oscar winners!

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone play excellently off each other with witty remarks and heartbreaking glances at one another, each adding to the already fantastic story in soulful ways.

But if you’re looking for something that depicts life at its most raw moments, the sad, the happy, and even the mundane, then this is it. There’s something inherently beautiful that is hard to depict about intimacy. Whether it’s the sense of comfort in the silence and the noise, or the knowing gazes that contain more emotions than words, this show depicts all of it beautifully. An audiovisual masterpiece. The score is subtle and muted, but fits the characteristic theme for Connell and Marianne. The emotive cinematography brings us up close with our protagonists, underlining how they feel separated from the world around them. One key effect they use is bringing the camera much closer to the foreground, making the background blurry and focusing the audience on the actor and actress. The acting is on another level by itself. Paul Mescal with his piercing blue eyes is indiscernible from Connell Waldron. His scene in counseling is one of my favorite scenes in the entire show, highlighting Mescal’s character study into Waldron. Daisy Edgar Jones is unbelievably beautiful as Marianne, drawing the trauma and abuse of the character into the foreground with a masterclass in acting. The story is a haunting one that explores the depths of emotions, both the good and the bad, and how they affect the human condition. There are some characters that I hate with all of my passion, some that deserved more depth, and some that remind us of ourselves. This show is rich and beautiful, but sad and plaintive at the same time. But I love it, for that reason.

It’s filmed like a music video (parts of it arguably were a music video, if anything), which isn’t a bad thing. There were many montages edited to fit the beat of the music. While visually entertaining, it did somewhat cut into what is already a skeleton body of a story. The story and premise is not new but the feminist approach to it was quite nice to see. Also to be noted, the normal horror tropes weren’t followed and we actually had people act smart in scary situations (for the most part). I particularly enjoyed the almost-Checkov’s Gun of having Molly’s friend find the house and then surprisingly (but understandably) leaving. Some parts of this movie (particularly the multitude of music montages) compounded to feeling like filler moments in an already short movie. Sebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar Jones had amazing chemistry, accentuating already great acting. But the biggest thing to catch my eye is definitely the visuals. I loved the “fresh” (pun-intended) look and perspectives that the moving shots had and even the still shots were so well framed. It’s a good horror movie, though it didn’t have much horror.",,2024-07-13
2024-07-21,When Harry Met Sally...,1989,https://boxd.it/6V0nth,5,,"“Anyway, it’s about old friends.” A seemingly throwaway line that means so much to Sally and Harry. When something is hailed as “the greatest romcom of all time”, you can’t help but be skeptical. But as I sat through all 90 some-odd minutes of this, I loved every second of it. The descriptions of this being timeless and Seinfeld-esque are apt. For a movie that’s thirty years old, it doesn’t feel like it. This movie about love would feel right at almost any point in history and that’s why it’s so beloved. The story doesn’t grow old even if the ones in it do. Most of the conversations had in the movie feel real and unscripted, Seinfeld-like. They say so little but at the same, mean so much. That montage of the phone call is one of my favorite scenes! It starts off with just the voiceover but shows them side by side just talking. Everything about this movie is spectacular, but I have to give props to the editor, whoever made the soundtrack, and the cinematographer. That edit of them side by side in bed on the phone watching Casablanca was so romantic to see. The soundtrack, filled with jazz tunes and Christmas songs, was so New York somehow. Those scenes as we see their friendship grow, it’s filmed in such a way where we feel like we’re peeking in on something private and it’s so well done. This is by all means, the best version of the friends to lovers trope and I’m all here for it.

2024-07-23,Poor Things,2023,https://boxd.it/6WmXZL,3.5,,"I’m going to start off by saying that I will definitely need to rewatch this movie sometime soon to really understand what I watched. And maybe even read the book to fully comprehend it all. Is it a movie I would watch with my family? Absolutely not, but find a good friend to laugh about it with and you’re golden. There’s something “play”-like about this movie. Whether it’s the physical comedy or the immaculate set design, the movie was made very well. This was a very visually stimulating movie to watch. Everything from the constant reappearance of the fish-eye lens, the expansive color scheme for the sky, to the graphic nature of the scene itself is a treat to the eyes. I read a comment calling this “Meth Anderson’s style” and I can’t help but laugh and agree with it. The story was confusing to me, but the more noticeable themes were parsed easily even if there are some parts that I’m too dumb to understand. In some ways, I would consider this to be a horror comedy. Think something akin to the Addams family. This movie does the comedy quite well and it’s accentuated by the acting masterclass. Emma Stone’s take on the mentality of what I would assume is a toddler growing into an adult was hilarious but reflective. Mark Ruffalo’s tantrums and rage at his misfortune is worth every laugh. Now there are some parts I did not enjoy much. Maybe I was too dumb to understand, but the recurrence of the fisheye lens was disorienting at times and while interesting to look at, didn’t add much to my interpretation of the story. Some parts were so visually stimulating that I felt that the CGI was overused. I particularly didn’t enjoy the soundtrack of the movie. While unique and maybe somewhat fit the movie, it was quite jarring to hear at times. I also would like an explanation of the world itself. Maybe this was one of those things where I just didn’t understand, but the worldbuilding, while visually entertaining, did not come through on the script at all for me. Bella’s amazing character arc did, but I do wish some exposition on the world itself because if you’re going to make a world look so appetizing, for lack of a better word, it deserves its own exposition. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this movie and I definitely need to rewatch it.

There was a part in this movie that had my heart caught in my throat till the very end. My eyes were tearing up and for the first time in a while, I melted into the seats of the theater and found myself reflecting. It’s just that good. This movie wasn't an easy one to watch for me I discovered (my sister thoroughly enjoyed it or at least that’s what she told me). I went into the theater with the mindset that like the first, it might be explaining some new emotions and be put in a situation that we’ve all been in to showcase them. But this movie went a bit farther than that. I love the story they crafted for Anxiety and Joy too. Had me feeling like Sadness in there. The callbacks to earlier scenes caught me by surprise and the movie really showcased that titular Pixar message throughout in so many hidden ways. The animation is beautiful and even better than the first one. I love how more of the minor characters had more screen time as well. I might still be emotional from my viewing but overall, I really loved this film. ",,2024-07-23

Anyways, this is American Harry Potter and you can’t change my mind. We have Nick Cage in prime form, leather jackets, cold stare, and all. We have Jay Baruchel acting at what he is known for best: looking weak and kicking ass by the end of the movie. We even have a clone of the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack. There were legitimate parts of the movie where I felt that they may have just copied the main theme from that series and injected it here. That’s not to say this wasn’t an incredibly fun movie. Sure, the story is not particularly great (but I will say original), acting didn’t have me in awe (Nick Cage was Nick Cage and Jay Baruchel was Jay Baruchel), but give me a quest, magic, and some guy who needs to conquer their fear to save the world and get the girl, and I’m thoroughly entertained.

2024-08-12,Deadpool & Wolverine,2024,https://boxd.it/75cqQx,4,,"This is Marvel’s return to form in many ways. There have been so much anticipation for this movie to come out since Disney bought Fox just to see if they would (in Deadpool’s terms) f*ck it up. And in short, they haven’t! The best part of the past two Deadpool movies was the “zero f*cks given” that is the ever so prevalent Ryan Reynolds/Deadpool style. And while Disney has upped the stakes, this movie has that classic meta comedy and gory action that Deadpool is known for. And this movie does it so well! No surprise, there are more than a few cameos (such a beautiful farewell and hello to the Fox era of the X-Men) and they work well within the story and if not that, the comedy is peak from them. Shawn Levy directs a beautiful action film with swift and chaotic choreography (they have their own version of the hallway scene from Oldboy!) as well as surprisingly delightful cinematography at times. Sure, the plot was skeletal at best if the tidal wave of jokes and action scenes didn’t fill in much of the body, but enjoyment wise, you couldn’t do much better. The playlist this movie had was James-Gunn-esque. Emma Corrin was terrifying with the small role she had. Matthew MacFayden was hilarious given the amount of screentime he had. Ryan Reynolds was Ryan Reynolds and it is ever so pleasing to see Hugh Jackman as gruff Wolverine self. This is fan service done right and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m hopeful that Deadpool continues on with his series and with the billion dollar box office that it crossed today, I have no doubts that it will. ",,2024-08-12

That last speech by Bartleby at the end nearly had me riling up to join South Harmon Institute of Technology. But joke’s aside, this is a surprisingly good movie. Justin Long was convincing as Bartleby Gaines, Jonah Hill was as hilarious as ever as Schrader, Lewis Black, the perfect cynical dean. These 2000s comedy movies were just different with their stories cause in no right mind would I expect to be watching a movie about a kid making a fake university and somehow make me root for him. A cult classic for a reason and one of the many peaks of 2000s comedy.

His name is Stephen Chow and the movies he made are legendary, reaching cult status today, Shaolin Soccer being one of his many masterpieces. This movie is a masterclass in balancing comedy, more comedy, and even more comedy in such a short time span. For a 90 minute film, I was chuckling if not howling in laughter for at least 75% percent of it. Take shitty CGI effects, classic action kung-fu fight scenes, and Chow’s comedic mind and you get this movie, and I couldn’t recommend it more. One gripe I do have is the fact that as a Cantonese speaker, those subtitles are sometimes so off, I had to go back, relisten, and make sure to not look at the subtitles. But besides that, such a funny movie. Oh and a soundtrack that has no right being that good.

2024-09-16,Before Sunrise,1995,https://boxd.it/7lfNm1,4,,"The hardest thing to get with any romance film, comedy, drama or otherwise, is the chemistry. You could have the most heartfelt lines that rival Shakespeare’s and the most stunning visuals that could make you the next *insert crazy visual artist/director here*, but what drives the romance genre as a whole will always be the chemistry. And this movie had so much chemistry to spare. The famed Richard Linklater directs a beautiful film about the birth of love and the naivety of such young love. It has stunning visuals of Vienna, a script that feels so unscripted you could have convinced me that it was all improvised, and two amazing actors driving this movie into becoming a classic staple of the genre itself. Ethan Hawke plays our cool yet awkward Jesse and Julie Delpy, our beautiful and independent Celine, and together make the audience feel so very single. This movie spans a singular night where we as an audience third wheel their date and watch as their love for one another grows with each word and glance. The dialogue between them feels unrestrained and unscripted from Hawke’s stuttering questions to Delpy’s strong opinions. We see the sights that they share as well as the glances they secretly take at one another and it feels awfully real for something classified as fiction. Someone said this movie reminded them of a podcast episode that just happened while touring Vienna and I can’t help but agree. I watched this movie while doing some homework and I was rather content just listening to their conversation from the pseudo-intellectual ideas that they ramble on about to the emotional statements that they spread so evenly throughout. Every now and then, I’d glance up and see the beautiful sights of Vienna (which were ever so lovely). At the end of the movie, there’s a short montage and through it, you understand how the chemistry of this singular couple can make a sparse yet beautiful place feel so alive and full. This movie might sound like the ramblings of a young couple but that’s what the birth of romance is. No one starts out sounding like Romeo, it just blooms into that and this movie perfectly defines it. ",,2024-09-15
2024-09-17,Before Sunset,2004,https://boxd.it/7ltCIN,4.5,,"This podcast episode is in Paris this time! A decade later! Jokes aside, this movie was just as romantic as the first, but in a different sense this time. Gone is that honeymoon feeling and untainted naivety in first loves, replaced by a hopeful longing and sweet nostalgia that these two now-adults don’t want to let go of. The acting, as per usual, is amazing. Again, it feels more documentary-like as we follow this couple/not-couple as they fight to catch up on lost time and yet, remember to restrain the feelings they had on that one night they had so long ago. It’s a beautiful film, less of the still imagery from the first movie and more moving scenes as Jesse and Celine are limited by the time that they have together. I’m a huge fan of the third act, the conversations they had felt unscripted and more couple-like than anything in the genre. Of course, this is due to the amazing direction of Linklater and the realism in the acting of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke. A sequel to what is already a classic in the romance genre, becomes yet another classic.",,2024-09-16
2024-09-18,Before Midnight,2013,https://boxd.it/7lUg7f,4,,"Throughout the course of this trilogy, the theme that has tied it all together is “love over time”. “Before Sunrise” was the beginning, showcasing the birth of love over a series of moments and conversations. “Before Sunset” is what love is in the present, what it means to fight for more time to do more things and spend just those few moments extra with the person you love most. This movie, “Before Midnight”, is about the future, where love has to mature and grow to last as long as you can possibly make it last. It’s a beautiful film like the first 2, though in a more downer tone. Sure, we have those romantic scenes between Jesse and Celine, just like the first two films, but they only postpone what is coming: the large conversation of what can they do to stay in love for the next however many years they still see each other. It’s well written which is an understatement considering how every word and dialogue of the movie feels so visceral and raw in the emotional sense. Though I do think the dialogue in this movie was a tad bit weaker than the others. Again, documentary-like with the cinematography, this time in gorgeous Greece. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy make this movie and its series what it is, their chemistry filling every scene to the brim with every spoken word. They do very much give the sense of an old couple far into their companionship, fighting to stay in love this time. This movie and the trilogy is a must-watch in the romance genre and for a good reason: It’s a walkthrough of how love starts, stays, and lasts. ",,2024-09-17

Move over Superman, Underdog’s got it. But in hindsight, it’s not a great movie. I still love it and it’s bad enough where it’s laughable, but it’s not great. The pacing was off, the story was lackluster if not the most cookiecutter hero arc, but I was very impressed by the ability to make the dogs look like they’re actually speaking, it looked quite real I must say.

2024-09-22,In Bruges,2008,https://boxd.it/7nHC7D,3.5,Yes,"In this modern absurdist comedy, if there’s only one word to summarize it all, I’d use “karma.” Colin Farell and Brendan Gleeson disappear into their respective characters, Farell playing the petulant adult plagued with guilt and Gleeson acting the jolly mentor looking out for his friend. And of course, Bruges plays its dutiful part as a set piece for Farell’s exclamation of “shithouse!” to Gleeson’s wonder at the “culture” that he drags Farell’s Ray to. Ralph Fiennes also played his comedic chops to the max, acting as the paradoxical ethical hitman. Martin McDonagh’s debut film is an especially tight and story driven piece, no word used that doesn’t have some use in the story whether as a comedic piece (I loved Farrell’s many comedic yet somber lines in this film) or a driver for the next part. Maybe not my cup of tea, it was a tad slow for the first half even though it had me chuckling a bit, but that third act was a masterpiece from its comedy to the climax of the story. ",,2024-09-21
2024-09-28,About Time,2013,https://boxd.it/7q2MKb,4.5,,"Life is a series of fleeting moments and this movie perfectly encapsulates that. It’s a clever story that weaves time travel into the grand story of life and it questions how we view fate and destiny. Appearing in most people’s lists when it comes to comfort films, “About Time” is a simple story that tells the life of a boy with a gift of time traveling. I’m sure we’ve all had that thought before, if we could go back in our lives what would we change? Sure the answers we think of most are money, mistakes, and accidents that we can rectify, but as Tim, played by the masterful Domhall Gleeson, discovers, some moments just aren’t worth giving up. I love how the story slows down as he realizes this, when he learns to enjoy life as is. And that he realizes that he can’t fix everything at the cost of his life. Though I do think it was a tad manipulative how he redoes his meeting with Mary over and over until he got it right. I really loved how this movie was filmed where there was never a still shot, always something moving. It’s filmed in a series of vignettes where we get some of the major moments and some of the minor ones, but that’s just how life is. A compilation of spectacular moments that we remember, the good and the bad. This really isn’t a story about love, but rather a story about life. Bill Nighy plays the father in this story and I can’t help but think that he should play more eccentric father roles. Him and Gleeson were just the perfect pair from the eccentricity in Nighy to the clumsiness in Gleeson. Rachel McAdams acted opposite Gleeson and was a charming act throughout. My favorite side character has to be the hateful playwright, played by Tom Hollander, dropping the funniest and hateful lines just for Tim to make up for that mistake. This film is the definition of comfort films, idealizing life as it is to show to the audience that we can’t change life, but we can do our best to enjoy it. ",,2024-09-27
2024-10-15,Little Women,2019,https://boxd.it/7yqewf,5,,"There’s very few movie adaptations (if any) that inspire me to pick up the novel it’s based on. For the most part, the movies never live up to the books’ quality. But this film had me looking for the book on my phone by the halfway point. Three fourths in, and I had already downloaded it, ready to be read. It’s next on my to-read list actually. Greta Gerwig directs a perfect movie adaptation, or really, just a perfect movie overall, in my eyes. The screenplay is sublime, the cinematography choices are excellent, and the star-filled cast disappeared into their roles. The story is deep and full of emotions. Each line or word always leads to something more, not a word extra or unneeded. That ending was magnificent, leaving it off on a subtle note that the author of the novel is Jo and that the audience can pick one of two endings or both to celebrate: her book being published as she watches like a mother with a newborn or that despite the hardships she’s been through, she’s found someone who appreciates and loves her for her intellect and independence. The use of the non-linear structure was excellent with the smooth transitions that reflect on both the past and the present. The cinematography was subtle but so significant to the movie. The non-linear structure of the story would have been confusing to run within so many other director’s methods, but Gerwig and her cinematographer Yorick Le Saux used clever color grading or lighting to both highlight the past and present. The past is in this warm sunlit color tone, whereas the present is more cool, blue, and dark. Every scene felt like an art piece. Hell, even just the places they filmed at are now on my places to visit. To the forefront of the film is the ensemble that put on an acting masterclass. Despite being set in America, to my surprise, none of the actresses playing the sisters are American. I couldn’t even tell! Saoirse Ronan plays our hotheaded protagonist and very much deserved the Oscar nomination for it. Timothy Chalamet is our love-struck male lead and while I’m not a huge fan of his acting in other movies, this truly was his showing as an Oscar-worthy actor. Florence Pugh, Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Chris Cooper, and so many others in this movie, even those minor characters, are deserving of their flowers. This movie feels perfect in so many ways and for once has me hoping that other good movie adaptations will come soon as well. ",,2024-10-14

And I made the mistake of skipping it when I was in theaters, choosing instead to watch it on my laptop with glare behind it. Regrets were definitely made. But still, this movie, from beginning to end (credits included), has such amazing imagery. And with it, world building as well. This movie really has such a unique premise and if anything, inspired me to read the book after as well. But it didn’t quite execute as well as I thought it would’ve. The non-linear structure of the story was jarring at times and left more questions than answers by the end. That’s not to say it wasn’t good though. The movie definitely warrants a rewatch if not multiple, but there are evidently some deeper thematic elements that I didn’t thoroughly understand (ideas of self-destruction and existentialism) Not a terribly big fan of the pacing throughout the film. But for me, I was really in awe of the acting, imagery, and world-building. Oh and the soundtrack was perfect for this cosmic horror show. This movie has a lot of potential (and I definitely missed a lot of it on my first watch), but the script doesn’t live up to it. Still definitely worth a rewatch! ",,2024-10-21

It’s not a complicated movie, if anything, it’s an idealization of phrases like “Just do it” and “The journey is more important than the destination.” But sometimes, that’s all that’s needed. Despite its average if not poor ratings when it first came out, this movie has gained admirers throughout the years after its release. And I can see why. This movie is an inspiring montage of the best parts of humanity. Where yes, we do have the stresses of life to think about, but we also have the freedom and the choices to live our dreams or even pick them back up after a long time away. The Scrubs-like introduction with the daydreams slowly fade away as Walter Mitty relives the dreams that he set down long ago. This movie has such a positive outlook on life that I couldn’t stop smiling throughout. Now combine that story and theme with such amazing cinematography and it’s perfect. The montages, scenery, and action feel visceral and real. I honestly couldn’t tell which parts were CGI (if any) besides the daydream sequences. If anything, this movie has given me a list of places to visit once I get the time. The acting was sublime, led by Ben Stiller who is also the director of the film. The soundtrack was so fun and fit the movie perfectly. All in all, a perfect movie when you need a pick-me-up or if you’re just looking to visit someplace far away.",,2024-10-22

Moneyball does that for me. Now I can’t say I’m not a sports fan, I lived around sports my whole life, hell, reading statistics from sports is a fun part of the projects I do. But when it comes down to it, sometimes watching sports games with my friends can be less than exhilarating for me. Much less nine innings of baseball. But Brad Pitt acting as Billy Beane saying “How can you not be romantic about baseball?” not once but twice really does inspire some of that team sports mentality. And ironically, despite the film being about this team being described as the “removal of old school baseball”, it really has the heart of the sport in it. Despite being a movie about baseball and statistics and was co-written by Aaron Sorkin, the writing wasn’t as Sorkin-like as I expected. Still deep with emotion, it guided the audience into understanding Beane’s past and present. The acting was excellent, Jonah Hill co-starring alongside Brad Pitt masterfully. The cinematography was a pleasant surprise, great use of the empty stadium to add to the scenery. Overall, just a great sports movie.

Some driving and some partying included as well but most of it is these guys just talking to each other. It doesn’t sound quite exciting but in my opinion, I don’t think it’s supposed to be. Our main character, played by an awkward Jon Favereau, is in a rut and his friends, played by future comedy star Vince Vaughn and Office Space legend Ron Livingston, are doing their best to get him through it. The thing I love about this movie is that it’s relatable. We’ve all been where Mike has been, down in the dumps and not exactly trying to dig our way out. We have stupid friends like Trent and Sue who do even stupider stuff to get us out of whatever dark hole we’re in. We have friends like Rob who are there to listen when we need someone too. And when you finally climb out of that hole that you’ve wallowed in, all of them are there to cheer you on. One of my favorite scenes in this movie is when Mike finally meets someone that he really likes and converses with, the camera switches over to Trent and Sue, both talking to someone themselves, but they start cheering for Mike, just going crazy and watching him “be money” as Trent puts it so many times in the movie.

When people say “sports is a religion”, I know what they mean. I live in the south, football (and sometimes basketball) is our bread and butter. Families live and breathe their college football colors. Bumper stickers and license plates are adorned with the symbols of their favored team. And moving up north for college, I learned quite quickly that hockey was the northern staple. Baggy hockey jerseys replaced the football jerseys that people wore. The campus store brandished all these hockey-themed products whereas the football jerseys were stuffed in the corner if they were there at all. It definitely helps when the hockey team is good (and maybe because of the permanently losing record of our college football team). That same buzz I get when I’m watching a football or hockey game with my friends, I saw here in this movie. At its heart, it is a story of grit and determination of a less than intelligent man named Doug Glatt and his ferocious love for hockey and the players within. Add in crude Canadian humor and unbelievable amount of fighting, you get this movie. It’s loveable, very very quotable, and, more than all of that, funny. Liev Schreiber and Sean William Scott were amazing in this movie. Jay Baruchel added in some crass but still very funny lines. Goon has all the hallmarks of a great sports film and even better Canadian comedy.

In true Edgar Wright fashion, the movie follows the music. Beat by beat, step by step. The first scene in the movie is this amazing one-take of our protagonist Baby getting coffee and each movement and step in the movie follows the beat of the song to perfection. Sound design is fantastic, switching in diegetic music as the scene needs. The editing is just as awesome. Edgar Wright is rightfully known as a world-class editor, if not the best. Each scene seamlessly transitions to the next, following the plot and therefore the music. The way this movie is filmed is by itself a masterclass. Fast and Furious cannot compete with the level of car shots this film has. As an audience, our hearts are pounding with each drift and squeal of the ride that Baby takes us on. And with it, the story is straightforward and romantic. Lily James plays excellently opposite Ansel Elgort. Jon Hamm, Eiza Gonzalez, and Jamie Foxx are each memorable characters in this story.

2024-11-14,The Breakfast Club,1985,https://boxd.it/7NLQ5N,4,,"“Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.” In the last scene, we watch as John Bender crosses the football field on his walk home, but compared to his entrance where he’s scowling and showing not a care in the world, here he is smiling and his fist is in the air in a note of triumph. This scene and line is iconic in film history and rightfully so. Whereas coming of age stories are a dime a dozen these days, John Hughes really led the charge for them in the 1980s, this film being one of the most famous if not the first movie that comes to mind when “coming of age” is said. It really is an excellent film with a story that’s driven by the differences in the characters and cinematography that’s both still and playful. Our leads were excellent, really driving forward the different cliques that they belonged to but also the problems that plagued them. The story hits on issues that are understood for anyone who’s been a kid. It’s a touching film that shines hope that there are people who understand us no matter the situation we find ourselves in whether it is all-day detention or not.",,2024-11-13

It has a surprisingly decent soundtrack and some moments that I enjoyed, but for the most part, the lack of depth in the story was not working for me. But that last act where revelations were made and stuff was actually happening, I enjoyed it. Jake Johnson’s little story arc was sweet and fun. Aubrey Plaza’s casual quirky self fit quite well in this. It’s a quirky movie that maybe mashes things that I don’t think mash well together, but surprisingly has a sweet undertone.",,2024-11-18
2024-11-20,Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle,2004,https://boxd.it/7QIGrP,4.5,,"Stoner comedies are a dime a dozen in the 2000s. I mean what could be more popular than a mid-budget movie about two idiots that get high and get in trouble? And very profitable too at that point in time. But somehow, this is more than that. What we get is this odyssey of two men who despite all odds reach the goal they both have been striving for as well as the goals they have been inwardly looking towards. Now that makes it sound a lot deeper than just saying that they really wanted White Castle, but this movie despite its simplicity speaks on racist tropes and stereotypes that are usually littered in these types of films. And better yet, they put two Asian male leads, played amazingly by John Cho and Kal Penn, as two regular people (no stereotypical accents) who just get high because they want to. So while it has the heart of a 2000s stoner comedy, it somehow also speaks on racist stereotypes. Throughout its 90 minute runtime, I don’t think I stopped chuckling or howling with laughter for a second. Sure, it has crass comedy, but if a movie can get me thinking about all of this and get me hungry for White Castle as well (unfortunately, the closest white castle is a 13 hour drive), I think it's a good movie and a fun time.

2024-11-21,Together,2021,https://boxd.it/7Rf5AV,3.5,,"Like most of the pandemic, the entirety of this film is set in one house, specifically 3 rooms. Not even upstairs, we only really see downstairs. Filmed like a Modern Family episode and set over the duration of the pandemic, Together is about a couple with relationship issues. The audience as something like a therapist watches as the relationship waxes and wanes throughout this movie. James McAvoy and Sharon Horgan are excellent in this, masterfully switching from talking to the audience and talking to each other. And above everything, the story feels human. Yes, the pandemic was (simply stated) not a great time for everybody and the story brings out the humanity in the problems and McAvoy and Horgan bares it out in the open for the audience to feel. As they talk directly to the camera, it feels like a conversation between the audience and them, though it does get a bit preachy at times. One of my favorite scenes is McAvoy sitting downstairs in what I suppose is his kitchen smoking and he’s talking to us about asparagus but it leads to him admitting that he’s trying to help Horgan’s character deal with her grief or in the least, push it away for a little while. This movie is a commentary on the pandemic and its effect on a family. Does it get preachy about certain subjects? Yes, but above all else, it’s a movie that showcases humanity in its most fragile moments. Plus it’s like watching an hour-long Modern Family episode but only more dramatic, Scottish, and Irish.

2024-11-21,Zodiac,2007,https://boxd.it/7RpxGn,4,Yes,"There’s no genre quite like thrillers. The ability to push the pace of a movie, no matter how long, just from the suspense, anxiety, and tension is something that only a thriller can do. Zodiac, masterfully directed by the well-renowned David Fincher, is a biopic of a killer that’s not seen on screen as well as a psychological thriller. Throughout the course of this movie, we learn just as much about the Zodiac Killer as our protagonist, Robert Graysmith played by Jake Gyllenhaal, does through his findings. It gives us sparse but extensive details that allows the audience to craft this dark and haunting idea of a suspect in their minds, even if we never see him (allegedly). We follow the labyrinthine clues and ciphers that the Zodiac Killer leaves behind in the movie and in real life. Filmed like a crime procedural and a newspaper story, Fincher expertly allows the suspense to guide the movie forward, never pushing too fast or too slow. It’s also quite a period piece, every set and scene giving off the 1970s. Cinematography was excellent, balancing the light and the dark to enforce that sense of suspense and anxiety throughout. Suspense is the driving force in this movie evidently. We never see the killer, but as an audience, we’re aware of him every step of the way. This movie somehow delves deep into the idea of a man but never lets him be seen. This tension of knowing but not seeing is what makes this movie great. And for the most famous serial killer of all time, there’s nothing more fitting than a suspense-filled David Fincher film. ",,2024-11-20

And for Mark Zuckerberg, it really should only be a success as his company is worth *checks Google* 1.40 trillion dollars present day. But director David Fincher ends the movie off not on this high optimistic note, but on this somber scene where Jesse Eisenberg playing our calculating and awkward protagonist is alone at the table where he’s settled his court case, refreshing the Facebook page on the girl who started it all. This movie doesn’t just describe the explosion that is Facebook, but also the tragedy of a man who once was surrounded by peers and at the end, is alone. Every scene in this movie was an acting masterclass, Andrew Garfield a standout. The cinematography is, as expected from a Fincher film, perfect, bringing the Massachusetts cold into the forefront. The script is a classic Aaron Sorkin masterpiece, words are weapons between the characters throughout and leave the audience hungry for more. The soundtrack is just sublime.

In this stop-motion animated film, Wes Anderson adapts a popular Roald Dahl story into reality. With a star-studded cast led by a podcast-worthy George Clooney, the movie dives into a story about a fox with a midlife crisis.

If I’m going to be fairly honest about my time learning piano and flute, it felt very much like that, and I saw and felt that in this movie too. Whiplash is a film about a destructive relationship between our protagonist, a drummer looking to be “one of the greats” and his mentor, a borderline psychopathic director looking to find that next great thing. As teacher Terence Fletcher, JK Simmons was a force in this film. He showcased the terrifying nature of a teacher obsessed with perfection, someone who justifies the ends to the means. Miles Teller was just as terrifying as student Andrew Neiman, masterfully toeing the line between insanity and genius, searching for that perfection that only him and allegedly Fletcher could see. The story is stressful, capitalized on by the intense dialogue. Its engaging but anxious tone captivates the audience, pushing towards the climax. Incredibly well-filmed, Whiplash cuts and moves to the jazz score in the background. The edits following each note to perfection. This movie lingers on an unknown ending, but maybe that’s for the best. We saw what happened the first time, but maybe this time will be different. Whiplash is a must-watch story of destruction that is both beautiful and haunting to watch.",,2024-11-23

Upgrade had me riveted to the screen from the beginning because of its incredible camera work. The fight scenes felt so smooth and robotic to watch which I guess fit the story of the AI controlling Grey’s body. And despite the age old trope of AI and humans working together, the story was well written and was engaging from beginning to end. Highly enjoyable with crazy action sequences!

2024-11-27,The Death of Stalin,2017,https://boxd.it/7Uj47j,4,,"See, when it comes to most history movies, there’s an expectation of two major things: Terrible to somewhat okay accents and attempts at finding actors that look like the original people. This movie had neither. But because of that, it was a great history movie. Because when you have such actors like New York Native Steve Buscemi and Yorkshire-speaking Jason Isaacs play Russians without so much as an attempt at Russian, “The Death of Stalin” takes on this sardonic role of introducing history in a hysterical manner. More akin to something out of “Drunk History”, this film depicts the chaos and struggle for power after Stalin’s death in dark humor. And it does it really well cause as much as I laughed during the 2 hour runtime, I was also rather interested in how contradictory and shitty those “Articles” they kept citing were written. And they were quite shitty. I wouldn’t be mad to see more history movies in this format because it was very entertaining to see a group of grown adults standing over a half-dead Stalin arguing about whether his pointing at a painting meant he was “the lamb”.",,2024-11-26
2024-11-28,The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,2024,https://boxd.it/7UU3sT,2.5,,"This is like if “Inglourious Basterds” was all action and no story. Don’t get me wrong, it was an entertaining film, I mean you have some of the most charming actors and actresses leading the way, including Henry Cavill, Alan Ritchson, and Eiza Gonzalez, so there’s some leeway there. But by the halfway mark for me, I realized that none of these characters were either going to die or even get shot. I was wrong by one bullet and one shoulder that seemed to be miraculously healed in the next scene, but I’m still right. Sure, gutting, shooting, and exploding enemies to victory was very entertaining in a classic Guy Ritchie fashion, but characters with no stakes, arcs, or development, much less depth, make for a very one-sided story. I had little interest in any of the characters, barring their one sentence quips they spewed everytime they killed somebody. And the plot was skeletal at best. It felt like the movie was supposed to be longer but everything about the characters was cut. I particularly hate how they mentioned having to take a shorter, but much more dangerous route (they highlighted dangerous extensively) and then proceed to skip past the entire 12 day route they had spent at least 10 minutes of screentime discussing just to jump to when they met up with their comrades after the trip. Oh and that was a horrendous Winston Churchill impression, historical inaccuracies aside. It’s a fun film that felt like a shitty “Inglourious Basterds” sequel. ",,2024-11-27
2024-11-28,Begin Again,2013,https://boxd.it/7UW6F1,3.5,,"Movies that make you feel good will never really get old for me. Movies like “Begin Again” where it’s a story of second chances and redemption are tales as old as time and should be retold again and again, no matter the setting. “Begin Again” is a story about a depressed music producer and a heartbroken songwriter who are both looking for something to love and the song they create together is just what they needed to rekindle that spark. Skipping past the rom com tropes of finding each other, they’re inspired to go back and see if they’re is still something left in the past and for one, there is, for the other, there isn’t. New York, of course, was the choice of setting for this, but you really can’t go wrong with the feeling of the night in New York just walking around with headphones on and they film it perfectly. On another thought, that splitter thing is also pretty cool. It’s a movie that’ll make you feel good plus a pretty decent soundtrack. ",,2024-11-27
2024-11-30,The Silence of the Lambs,1991,https://boxd.it/7VVTBT,4.5,,"There are very few movie adaptations that live up to the minimal expectations that readers of the books bring to the table. (As an Artemis Fowl and Percy Jackson fan, I’m forever devastated) Even fewer live up to the book’s name, or even surpass it, e.g. The Harry Potter movies. After reading the book and then watching the movie, I feel like the movie “Silence of the Lambs” delivers the definitive experience, even though it is an adaptation. And for the record, I love the book. Author Thomas Harris delivers a masterclass in immersion and characterization, but the movie not only adapts to perfection but also elevates it. Led by Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, the movie follows a rookie female FBI agent as she dives headfirst into a serial killer case. Director Jonathan Demme immerses us in Starling’s world through her eyes and the eyes of those around her through clever camera work. And it’s a depressing world. This movie conveys the uncomfortable gazes of everyone who opposes her from the male officers who see her as lesser to the psychopathic stare and smile of Anthony Hopkins’ terrifying take as Hannibal Lecter. The plot is a near copy to the book (as it should be), some of the lines even verbatim. And like the book, the movie allows the plot to unfold at its own pace, allowing tension and suspense to build with each scene. Howard Shore’s fantastic soundtrack captivates the anxiety of each scene as well. A fantastic psychological thriller and movie adaptation, “Silence of the Lambs” is well-deserving of its laurels and is a classic for the ages.",,2024-11-29

I was definitely more interested in the subplot that they had with Palmer about halfway through though.

And from the screenplay to the visuals, every aspect of the film kept me in awe for the 2 hours the movie ran. Led by a star-studded cast that are not yet in their prime (e.g. Chris Evans and Cillian Murphy), “Sunshine” is a movie about a group of astronauts on a mission to essentially “Big Bang” the Sun into reigniting. An interesting premise, crafted by the now-renowned Alex Garland and Danny Boyle, that depicts the beauty and brutality of the star so well. The visuals are stunning and are either a testament to how far ahead this movie was in terms of computer generated graphics or a damning indictment on how studios have been recently when it comes to rushed and/or terrible visual effects (looking at you Marvel). On the other hand, brilliant use of set design and practical effects drive an inescapable sense of claustrophobia aboard that spacecraft. And just as carefully crafted is the story. Earlier on, ethical dilemmas and struggles for logic drive this film forward. But from the opening scene to its final moments, the characters’ obsession with the Sun was always the calling card and the tonal change that supports it was just as frightening. Every part of this film drowns the audience in this immersive experience aboard what is the last possible chance for humanity and it is all so hauntingly beautiful. I could only wish I had seen it in theaters.

Which, if anything, is more of a compliment to Glen Powell’s stylist for every other look he had. As with all Richard Linklater films, chemistry is absolutely the highlight of the movie. Glen Powell and Adria Arjona match each other’s energy 100%. And for all the worry there was that Glen Powell can’t “lead a movie”, he’s led more than a few movies already (“Set It Up” is too good of a rom com to miss out on) and this would be the third rom com of his in recent memory anyways. The story was funny and filled with cheesy but cute moments though it felt a little rushed.

And like lead actor and director Jon Favreau’s past films, the heart of the film is in the people. “Chef” is on the list of so many people’s comfort films and for good reason.

In “Annie Hall”, Allen directs, writes, and acts as Alvy Singer, our protagonist, who is retelling his former love story with the titular Annie Hall, wonderfully played by Diane Keaton. And for a movie from 1977, it is astounding how relevant it is to the movies of today. The sarcastic wit, the non-linear story structure, the 4th wall breaks. These are some of the many parts of “Annie Hall” that are iconic even then and are even more iconic in classics that have come decades after its release. Even the cinematography of the classic New York sights is still used today. The funny thing is that despite the fact that “Annie Hall” birthed romcom classics like “When Harry Met Sally”, it itself is really not a romcom. The story from the beginning lets us know that the relationship is gone already, it’s merely retelling us via Alvy’s memories, the good and the bad. And it is a sweet story. Despite that Alvy is an asshole. Annie is carefree compared to the worrisome and neurotic Alvy. And the chemistry was palpable between Keaton’s Annie and Allen’s Alvy. So well-filmed too, especially that one-take where Alvy is talking to people on the street about his relationship. Also, if there’s one thing I’m glad for, it’s for the subtitles that I could clearly read instead of listening to Allen ramble on at a thousand miles an hour. A cultural revelation in the 1970s, “Annie Hall” is a sweet movie about a relationship that failed, but is more popularly known for the movies it inspired in its wake.",,2024-12-05

But that’s what the film was about. Fate and destiny are great and all, but having hope in life is the glue that holds it all together. That “tapestry of life”.

In “Shithouse”, Cooper Raith writes, directs, and leads this Linklater-esque movie about a college student trying to figure out his spot in the world. As a college student, it’s a scarily relatable movie that depicts the random drunk conversations, the meanderings everywhere, and ultimately the awkwardness of trying to fit in. The movie takes homage from Linklater’s Before Trilogy as we spend a healthy dose of screen time following Alex and Maggie on a drunken walk/conversation, setting up their differences and similarities. While not exactly a fan of the dialogue, it felt realistic and at times, even too realistic. Could this movie be shorter?

Getting the story would be an extra bonus. But, unsurprisingly, the best part of a movie that takes place in a single vehicle for 90 minutes is the story. Director Stephen Knight, who also created the famous “Peaky Blinders” TV show, crafts a riveting and anxiety-inducing movie that watches a man flush his life away piece by piece all in a car, phone call after phone call. Despite the movie only taking place in the vehicle, I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. As I listen in on the calls that Locke is making and answering, I can’t help but watch his reaction whether it’s him staring off into the distance with regret or silently sighing in relief. The heavy weight of the screenplay and extremely restricted cinematography relied on a masterclass in acting and Tom Hardy more than delivered– he excelled, perfectly portraying the deep regret behind his eyes and hopeful peace in his voice that Locke was hoping to imbue in his phone calls. The screenplay was excellent, pacing the story that slowly tumbled into tragedy for Locke. A man listening as his life falls apart, leaving him only with the journey he’s on, the car he’s in, and the dignity that he holds onto dearly. It’s a fantastic character study into a tragic character and it’s all contained between the beginning and end of a BMW commercial. I’m not joking, it really does begin and end like a BMW ad.

And we view them with rose-colored glasses because people want to remember the happiest moments, not the bad ones. We want to see the best in ourselves and others. But life isn’t just happy though. There’s an understanding some relationships have to end, for better or for worse. And these rose-colored glasses sometimes hide away why they end. In “500 Days of Summer”, we are looking at this specific relationship in the scrapbook of Tom Hansen’s life. Between 1-500, we are treated with a random assortment of days that Tom, excellently played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt, views through his rose-colored glasses. And from the start, it’s treated like a fairy tale with a narrator that tells far ahead of time that this isn’t a love story. Director Marc Webb reminds time and time again that Tom isn’t some love-struck hero destined to get the girl at the end. If anything, he’s someone who’s lost sight of what love is and is more infatuated with the idea of it than being in it. Zooey Deschanel is the supposed love interest and is the perfect foil for Tom’s perspective. And that ending where we view back all those moments with Summer without those rose-colored glasses ending on where the movie started is just perfect. Along with Tom meeting Autumn.

I was not good to say the least. But even then, musicals had a way of finding themselves into my song playlists whether that be pop culture trends like Hamilton and Dear Evan Hansen or by my annual search for a reminder of what the award show for theater was (it’s the Tony Awards). “Tick Tick Boom” is an excellent musical biopic of Jonathan Larson, the creator of the Broadway show “Rent”. Led by an amazing Andrew Garfield, it goes through Larson’s struggles of both finding an audience and finding himself while interspersing his greatest hits from the titular musical monologue “Tick Tick Boom.” And Andrew Garfield was a force in this movie, singing and all. He masterfully depicted the struggle of an artist, just begging to be seen and his singing was much better than I expected, it was very hard to not sing along. But then that’s what it was like for the whole movie. At one point, maybe it felt like a montage of songs, but the transition from song to acting was quite well handled. Garfield’s co-stars like Alexandra Shipp, Robin de Jesus, and Vanessa Hudgens felt at times underwritten but were great foils to Garfield’s Larson. Masterfully filmed and well acted, Miranda’s directorial debut is a hit in more ways than one and is a catchy biopic too.

2024-12-13,The Circle,2017,https://boxd.it/82o32f,1.5,,"For the record, I chose to watch this movie because the reviews were just so poor that the movie just felt like a must-watch— but this movie is jaw-droppingly bad. There’s a quote from the job interview in this movie: “What’s your greatest fear?” “Unfulfilled potential.” This movie stinks of that line. The premise of privacy and technology is one that may be overused in movies, but even a subpar film could’ve made it somewhat entertaining or, in the very least, watchable. In 120 minutes, that theme and idea is drowned in poor acting, trashy cinematography, and an even more abysmal story. To say they even had a story is already a lie in itself. Characters are so underwritten that the plot collapses on itself. John Boyega could've been called Batman the way he’s hiding in the shadows or better yet, not been in the movie at all, and would not have affected the movie a bit. Karen Gillan’s miraculous recovery from turning into a hermit had no meaning whatsoever. Mercer, our protagonist’s catalyst, is so underwritten that he’s only known by one defining trait: his antler chandeliers. The plot can’t develop when there’s no characters to work with, much less Mae Holland who as far as I can tell is just there for the ride. That ending wasn’t even an ending. They spent what can allegedly be called the “third act” setting up this climax just to have Holland open a door and transition into her kayaking under drones for the fourth time in this movie, leaving an ending so ambiguous they would’ve been better off saying she disappeared into Narnia by a closet. Look I have the utmost respect for Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, but they had a better chance of actually working at Google than saving this story. And honestly acting-wise, it wasn’t great either. I’m particularly haunted by those 2 “Circlers” who were trying to convince Watson’s Holland to join the social network they were all on. I felt like I was being hassled for not turning my homework in early. And I have the stinging belief that the filming crew were inspired by Hinge and Twitter ads, the way they filmed it all with the flying speech bubbles and over-contrasted California sunlight. It’s damning to read that this is a film adaptation of a popular book because now I’m convinced the book has to be good for the movie to be this bad. Overall, I’m only giving points because I enjoyed the end credits, charming Tom Hanks, and the Google vibes of it all. Maybe someday, I’ll think about making this review shorter, but it felt good to hate on a movie for a paragraph or two. Thanks for coming to my TED talk!

2024-12-14,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,2004,https://boxd.it/82QJcd,4.5,,"I don’t think many movies can get away with showing the ending of a film as the beginning, much less a romance film like this one, if you can call it a romance film. “What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she’s a stranger.” This is a line we hear from Jim Carrey’s Joel Barish as he’s listening back to the recording that he made to forget Kate Winslet’s Clementine Kruczynski. Joel is looking at Clementine as this plays and the two are trying to confront what they now know: they’ve tried this once already. And failed. Now here they are, are they willing to try again? I think we all have some memories that we wish to erase, whether it’s as simple as an embarrassing moment or as deep as a relationship that didn’t end well. We all know and at some point have believed the saying “Ignorance is bliss.” What we don’t know won’t bother us. While it’s tempting to believe that about life experiences, this movie serves as a reminder that life only moves forward. That there’s no erase or undo or a redo. It’s life and we have to keep moving forward and bear the pain and mistakes that come with it. The story is only a part of the beauty in this film. I am especially in love with the way they filmed memories and dreams, almost as if we’re chasing Joel and Clementine from the perspective of the “technicians.” The colors fade in and out and scenes blur from the background in ways that only feel dream-like. And in the center of it is Joel and Clementine. Carrey and Winslet are excellent at playing these deeply flawed but still hopeful characters, adding an acting masterclass to the dream-like cinematography. Altogether creating an intensely beautiful film that rips at the heart strings with an ending that leaves much to ponder. ",,2024-12-13
2024-12-15,Neighbors,2014,https://boxd.it/83emJh,3.5,,"I feel like Seth Rogen has the wildest ideas for comedies and just writes down any random thought that could be made into comedies. Like “The Interview” or this movie? Wild premises all around! Plus this movie might have the crown for the weirdest live action fight scene I’ve possibly ever seen. I mean if I told anybody that Seth Rogen fights a jacked Zac Efron with dildos, a frat paddle, and a trampoline in a scene, I don’t think they’d believe it. Plus a love confession between Dave Franco and Zac Efron, both of whom I usually got mixed up back then. It’s a really funny movie all around, Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne has great comedic chops, and Dave Franco plus Zac Efron make a crazy good duo surprisingly. ",,2024-12-14
2024-12-15,Sorry to Bother You,2018,https://boxd.it/83nR0l,3,,"I didn’t think that I had a limit for absurdity or parody but this movie comes close, like we’re talking inches away from pausing it and scrubbing my eyes. “Sorry to Bother You” is a seriously funny parody on life and has poignant themes about capitalism and racism while throwing the dictionary definition of absurd in your face. Lakeith Steinfeld hilariously leads this movie in such a relatable way despite the insanity that follows. And it’s a beautiful film too. Clever usage of scenery, contrasting colors, and angles (and a healthy dose of what I hope is CGI) really drive home the absurdity of it all. But while this film talks about classicism and greed, it doesn’t do it subtly by any means. It quite emphatically takes the audience for a thrill ride and at the end, drowns them to drive home the point. Now that I think about it, this movie is the Splash Mountain of movies. While I enjoy the forwardness where most films would choose a more subtle approach, at one point, it does lose its focus on its integral themes for me. Because I’m feeling like using one more metaphor for today, this movie goes from 0 to 60 on the highway in the first 2 acts with some questionable cutting and swerving, and then goes from 60 to “wtf” in a span of seconds by driving off a bridge for the finale. Even then though, I enjoyed the film for its parodied take on divisive themes and maybe it does go too far, actually it definitely goes too far, but this style of absurdity and insanity is not common and is a must-watch.",,2024-12-14
2024-12-16,Adventureland,2009,https://boxd.it/84a4Ep,4,,"It’s an oddly beautiful movie. I mean an old and run down carnival in the middle of nowhere suburbia with the 1980s glow would not be my first choice of “beautiful destinations” but yet in this 100-minute movie, it’s oddly perfect. In “Adventureland”, Jesse Eisenberg stars as James Brennan, a recent college graduate who has to work a summer job at the nearby carnival to scrape together enough money to move to New York for grad school. He meets new people, finds love, and makes mistakes as he struggles to find what he is in the place he doesn’t want to be. So no, it’s not a new or unique story in the coming-of-age genre, but it perfectly captures that feeling of wanting nothing more than to get out of this place. Jesse Eisenberg surprisingly makes a charming protagonist as he ditches that typecast “nerd” that he usually plays for a more awkward and flawed character who’s struggling to get used to his current scenario. Kristen Stewart perfectly plays a flawed character who, like others in this movie, is trying to numb her pain despite living in a place that pushes for it. I love the reality this movie upholds and rather than laying into the comedy that I would expect the director of “Superbad” to deliver, Greg Mottola encapsulates the melancholy and everyone’s internal need to escape the suburbia they were born in. It has laughs for those who're looking for the antithesis of “The Social Network” and it has tears for those looking to escape their own life for 100 minutes. It's a beautiful film that captures the essence of entering adulthood in the most heartfelt and beautiful way: in the golden hours of an old and rundown carnival hosting its own island of misfit toys.",,2024-12-15
2024-12-18,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,2016,https://boxd.it/84WrN1,3.5,,"I’m a tad sick while writing this so maybe it’s the cold-addled brain saying this, but this movie is why “Pride and Prejudice” is one of literature’s best stories. Because if your period piece or romance story can’t survive a tad bit of zombification, it’s just not on the same pedestal as “Pride and Prejudice”. “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies” is exactly as the title sounds. It’s the original classic with a sprinkle of zombies in the mix. And it’s wildly entertaining. Led by a stunning Lily James, the movie retains the charm of the classic love story with the action of a zombie flick. And it’s a delightful two-in-one. When I got bored from the period drama, I was pleasantly entertained by a gory fight scene because a zombie would just so happen to wander in. And if I got bored from the mindless fighting, they’d somehow charmingly combine it with what I believe might be direct quotes from the actual book. Overall, maybe not the best in either world, I mean Kiera Knightley’s Pride and Prejudice is a cult classic for a reason and zombie flicks are a dime a dozen with incredible amounts of creativity, but I don’t think you’re gonna find another genre combination like this one that has this much fun. But now, I do hope that they do this with period pieces because I’d be thoroughly entertained if you told me that King Arthur (real or not, up to you) had to fight zombies while wielding Excalibur.",,2024-12-17

It might not be a Christmas classic either but it has that Christmas spirit and wonder that should come with any film around this time of year. Sure, it might have some horrible CGI and bland product placement for the sake of sponsorships, but I watched this in an empty theater and genuinely had an alright time. Chris Evans put his absolute all into this role and was certainly entertaining. The Rock played the Rock and J.K. Simmons makes quite a pleasant Santa Claus surprisingly. I liked it!",,2024-12-17
2024-12-19,Bruce Almighty,2003,https://boxd.it/85oF8x,4,,"I feel like this movie satisfies two key notions we’ve all had: What if we were god aka all-mighty, all-powerful, all-omnipotent, and what if we had Morgan Freeman play god? I mean his voice just produces a godly aura. “Bruce almighty” is a classic Jim Carrey film about a normal man who’s been handed the powers of almighty god after telling god himself (that is of course Morgan Freeman) that he sucks at his job. And despite the comedic element of it, it is surprisingly a deep movie! Jim Carrey’s physical comedy was in peak form and was a delight alongside Morgan Freeman’s destined role as god. Jennifer Aniston was a great counterpart to Jim Carrey. All of whom helped underscore the story’s sense of humanity. Because as much as any of us want shortcuts for life, if we had them, we’d miss out on the best parts of it. The tiny details that we might not remember but make us feel good when we see it. It’s a great feel-good film with Jim Carrey at his best and it’s just a blast. ",,2024-12-17
2024-12-19,Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping,2016,https://boxd.it/85GbQZ,3.5,,"In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have been watching Lonely Island videos back when I was younger, but they were for sure entertaining. The Lonely Island is a comedy group well known for their eclectic and eccentric music videos. Most recently “Sushi Glory Hole” (Three words that have probably never been in that order) and my personal favorite out of their discography “I Just Had Sex” featuring Akon. This movie is basically the Lonely Island movie and is a popstar mockumentary that contains some of the catchiest and most explicit songs I’ve ever heard. But I wouldn’t have it any other way. Where else would I hear a song about sex and Osama Bin Laden? And surprisingly, it’s also a feel good movie about friendship! If you’re looking to spend 90 minutes bopping your head to songs that you can never sing in public with the bonus of a “friendship is magic” plot, I definitely recommend this! I’m slightly tempted to add their songs on Spotify but I’d rather not see it on my Spotify Wrapped next year so I might just have to watch this movie a few more times instead.",,2024-12-18
2024-12-20,Go,1999,https://boxd.it/86d60b,3.5,,"This movie embodies the quote “All’s well that ends well.” And makes quite an understated Christmas movie too. “Go” is a Soderbergh-esque film where a drug deal intertwines four unlikely people: a sales clerk selling aspirin, two gay actors being blackmailed by a cop, and a drug dealer taking the weekend off in Vegas. A three-part narrative with a remarkably tight script, the movie is a dynamic and hilarious adventure no matter which storyline you follow. Director Doug Liman excellently captures the chaos and insanity that pursues the various characters and is surprisingly adept at capturing the feeling of being high (the supermarket scene in particular). The future all-star cast were perfect in their roles, Timothy Olyphant, the likeable ecstasy dealer, Sarah Polley, the confused drug dealer, William Fichtner, the creepy MLM dealer… There was a noticeable amount of dealers in this movie. Overall, this movie never loses your attention. Filled to the brim with sharp wit and even dumber characters, “Go” takes you on an adventure in 3 different ways and never lets off the gas.

2024-12-21,Primer,2004,https://boxd.it/86zw3f,4,,"I wanna preface that I read the wikipedia synopsis plus the graphic that explained how it worked before I watched this and I still got lost about halfway through, but I do understand one thing: We would all end up more like Aaron than Abe if time travel ever gets invented. “Primer” is a scifi movie that takes the concept of time travel and drowns your brain in it. And for a $7,000 film, it surprisingly delivers the definitive experience on what time travel is. Also in a cheeky way, the best depiction of engineers I’ve ever seen. Because what better way to show engineers than to show them discovering something that wasn’t even intentional and then trial run it like guinea pigs. Unlike movies like “Tenet” or “Back to the Future”, this movie’s lack of special effects and action sequences make for a more nuanced film. Director, writer, actor (and basically every other role too according to the credits) Shane Carruth throws all the tropes of time travel out the window, leaving behind a crafty story and a tight script to lead the audience. No unneeded exposition or comedy relief. Sure, you can argue that like “Tenet”, the need to rewatch to fully understand the story is a sign of weak storytelling, but on the contrary, the need to understand isn’t crucial to the story in “Primer”. While it serves as an excellent puzzle (that I still have to decipher despite reading 4 different reddit threads on the topic), the simplistic and lackluster depiction of time travel produces a sense of wonder on what could be possible with it. I was glued to the screen at what could be. Two normal people discover time travel by accident. What can they do with it? Carruth efficiently revitalizes the time travel genre in an approachable way with “Primer”. A puzzling but exciting movie that is pure scifi at its best. ",,2024-12-20
2024-12-22,On the Count of Three,2021,https://boxd.it/876tQp,3.5,,"In 90 minutes, I went through the entirety of the emotional spectrum. And when you’re starting off the movie with your two protagonists counting up to three with guns pointed at each other in a suicide pact, you’re putting the hardest part first arguably. I don’t know what to call this movie. Comedy seems too loose of a term. Depressing? It is, but it also isn’t. “On the Count of Three” is a depressing dark comedy film about two best friends who have decided that their last day is today. And while they might be improvising it, they learn that to appreciate life on their last day, they gotta do stuff that they have never done. Director and actor Jerrod Carmichael balances this heavy subject with these moments of levity, excellently crafted with a tight script and close perspective. Christopher Abbott puts on a masterclass as Kevin lights up on the depressing possibilities of no tomorrow. Abbott and Carmichael form the perfect chemistry as they wander through their different headspaces: Carmichael’s introspective, but hard-headed nature, and Abbott’s excitable, but terrified mindset. And the comedy is depressingly amusing, but so devastating all the same. It’s a heavy film that contains the lowest of lows but also the highest of highs as we watch two best friends dive into the regrets of a life that probably isn’t gonna see tomorrow, but also a friendship that will outlast them.",,2024-12-21

I mean imagine if they got Antonio Brown to do a mockumentary of football. Not only do I think that he would jump into the seat to do it, he’d probably half the script to ensure mockery of the sport. Surprisingly this movie also contains an all-star amount of cast members that I wouldn’t think have done this. Freddie Highmore playing a lady playing a gay man on a bike is amazing. Jeff Goldblum is perfect as an old Andy Samberg. I mean it’s comedic genius. Full male nudity, crass humor, and award-winning cast members like Dolph Lundgren, John Cena, Daveed Diggs, and Orlando Bloom, just to mock a sport is hilariously overkill but at the same time, the needed amount of comedy.

I mean I heard this movie first from a Percy Jackson novel, “Mark of Athena” if I remember it right. The god of the Tiber River was Gregory Peck and the mother of Rome was Audrey Hepburn in the story. Sixty years later, this romantic comedy is mentioned in a book for middle schoolers, so it stands to reason that something about it must be memorable. I just didn’t expect it to be everything. “Roman Holiday” is the story of a princess who escapes from her royal duties for a day and finds herself in the company of a news reporter who falls in love with her. It’s not a complex or even unique story, but the way it’s filmed is just as beautiful as it is charming. A graceful Audrey Hepburn and a charismatic Gregory Peck form the perfect duo as they meander across the beautiful city of Rome, the cinematography catching the picturesque buildings and landmarks behind them despite the black and white film. The script is organic and filled with comedic flair that both actors match too perfectly with chemistry bubbling. The ending is bittersweet but leaves a note of wonder and hope because what better way to leave a romantic story than a longing gaze. A sweet and delightful story, this movie is a timeless classic that’ll give anyone a travel bug for Rome and the magic in it. ",,2024-12-21
2024-12-23,Columbus,2017,https://boxd.it/87Tlsn,5,Yes,"This was due for a rewatch and a better review. I really love movies that can make a location come alive and become its own character in the story. Kudos if they actually film it there and make sure the landmarks are in the movie. Think movies like “La La Land”, any Woody Allen movie set in New York, or even further back, “Roman Holiday”. In “Columbus”, we watch as two people bond over their home, the titular Columbus, Indiana. It doesn’t sound like the most fascinating plot and honestly, it doesn’t have much of a plot. But the movie is as beautiful to watch as it is calming. It’s a story of parallels where one calls it home, feeling a need to stay and the other sees it as purgatory, a passing period after which he’ll be free. A quiet and slow drama that brings up questions of passion and sacrifice as well healing. John Cho and Hailey Lu Richardson beautifully bring forth the characters of Jin and Casey, excellently depicting the touch of sadness that holds them to this town. These two characters are perfect foils to one another and we observe as they learn from each other how to heal. And as someone who also stares at buildings for an absurd amount of time like Casey does, I love how this movie is a love letter to architecture. Every scene in Kogonoda’s “Columbus” perfectly frames the landmarks and the people within in a picturesque and peaceful way that only a painting in a museum can. With virtually no camera movement, every scene feels meticulously framed like a painting or a photograph  for just a few seconds, only for the characters to move and show that it isn’t. The film score matches the tranquility on screen, contemplative and serene. The sound design is spectacular, embracing the silence that surrounds our characters. All around, it’s a beautiful film that mirrors the beauty of life, the monotony and the novelty. An audiovisual masterpiece, it’s a reminder to sit still for just a second and look for the beauty in what’s right in front of us.

It was not a great sign when this was my first thought on the movie. “Ghosted” is an Apple TV production about a love story between a spy and a normal person. Ana De Armas and Chris Evans make for a charming lead duo but can’t carry the lackluster movie to higher heights.

Quirky yet cute chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan, insane but weirdly perfect duo between a crazy Adam Driver and Mackenzie Davis, and a soundtrack that belongs on my 2010’s Spotify playlist. “I JUST HAD SEX AND I'M ABOUT TO EAT NACHOS!!” is not something I could imagine Driver ever saying, but that scene was godly. It hits all the romcom tropes and delivers two quirky people becoming one quirky couple with one of them being a charming Daniel Radcliffe so I can’t hate it.",,2024-12-23
2024-12-25,Wicked,2024,https://boxd.it/89ryJD,3.5,,"I realized about ten minutes in that I like having subtitles when I’m watching a movie because if they start singing, I’m too distracted by the melody and what’s on the screen to actually listen to the words. To say the least, this movie was very catchy! As a non-theater person, I’m assuming that it’s as good an adaptation as it is a movie, because it is quite well made! Production and set design were amazing, immersing me in a world that’s reminiscent of Hogwarts from Harry Potter. I will comment that the lighting felt a little off at certain points. Dance choreography was thrilling and took use of the sets. The colors were bright and vibrant on the theater screen (maybe sometimes too bright). Director John Chu has become well known for crafting beautiful and tangible sets in his movies, but especially his musical movies like this one. All of which to push off a wonderful dynamic between Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. Both were perfect in their roles, Grande as a self-serving but ultimately friendly Glinda and Erivo as independent but aloof Elphaba. Their chemistry was infectious on the screen, and their many duets throughout the movie were eye-catching! But then again, that was basically all the songs. Chu paced the movie well despite the alarming amount of songs I learned were in the movie, placing plot scenes within the songs so it doesn't feel like a jolt when they burst into song. I will say though that they definitely milked “Defying Gravity” for all it had, because I thought they ended the song four different times only for them to continue, turning what is a four minute song into a fifteen minute finale. Not that I minded of course, Grande and Erivo were an amazing duo and the cinematography was stunning in that finale. But for a nearly three hour runtime, all of this is a lot. And there's part two coming next year. Maybe it could’ve been a tad bit shorter, but this is an incredibly catchy movie with stunning visuals, so I expect nothing less from the sequel!",,2024-12-24

You get cheap CGI monsters, people dying in the wildest ways, comedy from the funniest actors in the industry, and a load of cameos that had no reason being as good as they were. I mean they extensively had Michael Cera play himself but as a coke addict. And while the story was absolutely insane, the comedy was off the rails too, but also the best part of the chaos. I mean you put Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, James Franco, Jonah Hill, and Jay Baruchel in a room together, and amidst all the cursing and trash insults, there’s bound to be something funny. And it really is. Meta-comedy that mocks Hollywood, actors taking digs at themselves, lines upon lines of double meanings that had me laughing with tears. And for most of this movie, if I wasn’t laughing, I was in shock at what I was seeing. If you told me that Seth Rogen improvised this movie from beginning to end, I would believe it and I wouldn’t care.

The synopsis on Wikipedia is two sentences long. That’s how little plot there is in this ninety minute movie. And yet, I found myself riveted to the screen. In this film, we watch an introvert live her life. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. Alongside a tinge of depression. Despite how mundane it may seem, the beauty in this movie is in the simplicity and relatability of this character. We watch as she struggles to participate in the more active parts of life. She doesn't shy away from it, much less avoid it, she just struggles to step into the light and when she can’t, she slips away. She’s both seen and unseen, observing the world around her rather than acting in it. And it’s oddly cute when she’s finally met a person who’s she’s willing to at least try for. Daisy Ridley is captivating as our protagonist Fran, channeling the silent introspection that’s teetering into depression. It’s a subtle and quiet performance where we’re not focused on what she is saying but what she’s listening to and seeing. The cinematography is beautiful in a Columbus-esque way, depicting Astoria in a gloomy but romantic glow. Each scene is meticulously set and adds to the monotony of Fran’s life, but also shows the beauty that she’s missing out on. The score is whimsical and belongs in an old Disney fairy tale, but it also highlights the surrealism of her thoughts. I was drawn to this movie from beginning to end. At first, it was the amazing scenery. I had a travel bug for Astoria, Oregon within the first five minutes. But then, it really was the feeling the film captured perfectly that kept me watching: The world can go on without you. It’s a grim, depressing, and maybe dull film. We spend this movie watching and waiting, not for an epiphany or even a large action, but a confession. It’s a wholly relatable film that almost hurts to watch, but is also too beautiful to look away. ",,2024-12-26

We follow Mannix as he fixes the problems of Hollywood, or at least his little production corner of it. And as we watch the movies within this movie and his role as a “fixer”, we see the stresses that push him, but also the little joys that he works for. This movie cleverly parodied an older generation of film but also gave it an homage through the extravagant set production and clinical attachment to the era they are representing. And the all-star cast couldn’t have done it any better. An exhaustive list of actors and actresses that each have their own roles to play within the parodied film industry alongside a surprising number of cameos that didn’t overstay their welcome. The script is tight, drawing laughs from the physical comedy of the scenes as well as the sarcastic wit that underlies most of the lines. This parody of 50’s Hollywood is absurd and hilarious in all the best ways, but is also surprisingly warm to end on. It’s also a reminder to watch more Coen films.",,2024-12-27

The other half is reminding me that I broke my arm because I didn’t tie my shoes while riding a bike full speed down a hill. This movie is filled with stupid characters, and I mean astronomically stupid. Like if they bothered to talk for a bare minimum of thirty seconds, they could’ve hashed it out. They still wouldn’t have been fine cause they were far into the “going to end terribly” category within the first five minutes of the movie, but at least, they would have understood what was going on. And I love movies like this! While some movies are more entertaining because you can yell at the screen over how stupid the characters are, this film's characters are so stupid that I'm left more awestruck than anything else. Does it feel like the Coen brothers took a random plot generator and somehow made them work? Yes. But it works to an hilarious degree! It’s situational humor at its best! Brad Pitt made the most out of an immensely stupid character and Frances McDormand was a blast to watch just arguing with an insurance company. An absurd comedy about stupid people is a genre I’ll never get tired of, and this movie belongs on the Mount Rushmore of the genre. ",,2024-12-28

There’s something incredibly sweet about this line because it’s a reminder that no matter what stage of life we’re in, the ability to have fun is purely on us. And this movie embodies that perfectly, a hilarious and deep film about a group of people who still enjoy the game of tag even in their different stages in life. It’s a story of great friendships and enjoying life even if that means playing tag every May in your forties. Ed Helms, Jon Hamm, Hannibal Buress, Jeremy Renner, and Jake Johnson have great chemistry and are just perfect on the comedic timing. The action scenes are surprisingly well done and the voiceovers are the icing on the cake. All to embolden a story that’s pure fun and hits at the heartstrings.

I would do too if I’m being honest with myself. That moment of levity is only part of how much this movie is an emotional roller coaster. And to only be framed as a romcom is a travesty, because while at its core is this love story, it’s a family drama and cultural film too. And it excels at all of it. This film balances laughter with heavy topics to perfection, crafting a tone that blends the dry humor with emotional stakes, embodying the essence of this movie. Doing this requires an excellent cast and they might’ve found the perfect one. Kumail Nanjiani plays himself in this semi-autobiographical picture and delivers great chemistry with Zoe Kazan. But the stars are Holly Hunter and Ray Romano in my opinion. Playing the parents of Kazan’s Emily Gardner, their worry for Emily is riveting and heart-wrenching to watch. Nanjiani’s humor plays perfectly against Romano’s stoicism and Hunter’s anxious energy, creating outstanding chemistry among the trio. On the cultural side, this movie is brilliant at depicting the challenges Nanjiani faces. It doesn’t shy away from, but ultimately respects the differences in cultural values that Nanjiani is fighting through. What makes this story so good is the honesty of it all. Learning Kumail Nanjiani wrote this alongside his wife Emily Gordon is as good an ending as you can get from a rom com like this, even if they leave off on a satisfying and hopeful open-ended conclusion. This film has so much heart and emotions that blends well with the many laughs that it offers. It’s a brilliant love story that’s modernized and unafraid to show the diversity of today’s world at its warmest. ",,2024-12-30
2025-01-01,Kung Fu Hustle,2004,https://boxd.it/8fS2zz,5,,"I only wish I could’ve seen this for the first time all over again. I grew up with Cantonese movies. My dad had them downloaded on this hard drive in shitty quality and no subtitles. We’d watch them as a family on the weekends when I didn’t have school. It was perfect then when I was in elementary school and it’s still perfect now. And it’s an indictment on the comedy genre that nothing has come near being as good as “Kung Fu Hustle” was in the last two decades. And it holds up! Director and lead actor Stephen Chow delivers laughs upon laughs with amazing action sequences and quietly stunning cinematography. Part gangster film, part martial arts, part slapstick comedy, part hero’s journey, it has something for everyone. And I mean everyone, it has a Spider-man quote to cap off a major fight scene. The physical comedy is a signature of Chow’s films and this film is no different. Insanely quotable and hilarious characters, the movie excels at comedic timing, even taking inspiration from other popular comedies. And the mix of physical comedy and action sequences are some of the best there is. Hong Kong films are excellent at action sequences and “Kung Fu Hustle” is one of the best among them. The fluidity and over-the-top nature of the choreography is unlike anything in Hollywood and the slow-motion shots and dramatic camera angles only add to the hilarity that’s already there. And I mean these fights are like something out of anime, one of scenes had our main character fighting with the hand of Buddha and the other was doing his best toad impression. Maybe the best fight scene in a movie ever. It’s a perfect movie all around and a classic in Asian cinema. It’s cinema at its finest, entertaining, heartfelt, and so creative, one of my favorite films ever.",,2024-12-31

And after rewatching it, it deserved a new rating and a better review. I feel like everyone’s got that one movie that they love to quote from. This is my favorite movie to quote from. With such a tight script and highly stylized cinematography, I always have a blast with this movie. “Game Night” takes what is a simple and ridiculous premise and makes a masterpiece out of it with an incredible cast, creative camerawork, and an extremely fun script. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams make a surprisingly good duo in this movie, perfectly bouncing off each other comedically. Billy Magnussen, Sharon Horgan, Lamorne Morris, and Kylie Bunbury deliver on hilarious chemistry and Jesse Plemons is a remarkable comedic actor with his deadpan expression in this movie. What caught my eye in this film is the incredible cinematography and camera work. Not many comedies get creative from a visual standpoint, but this movie really takes the “Game Night” theme to heart and leaves it all there to see from the board-game look of the beautiful tilt shift shots to the excellent one-take scene of “Hot Potato”. The crafted shots and fast edits add to the tension and pace, but above all, the absolute fun. It’s a hilarious movie and the tight script really sells it. Character introductions, plot, and twists are all so well-done and clever. It’s a very economical script where no lines are wasted and are still very quotable and funny. “Game Night” is visually entertaining and contains a sharp script that’s funny and quotable. One of the best comedies of recent times! Plus I always have an itch now to recreate those tilt shift shots. ",,2025-01-01

Weird comparison that I drew halfway through but it’s an apt one. It has that stylish director Danny Boyle flair so visually it’s quite fun to see and it has heart in the script though it does falter a bit for its weird need to revere the Beatles at random points. I love the premise and the continual random searching of items that just disappeared. I mean to think if someone decided to rewrite Harry Potter and publish it themselves would be hilarious. It’s a fun movie with a great soundtrack (as expected) and very much worth a watch!",,2025-01-03
2025-01-05,Stuck in Love,2012,https://boxd.it/8k2v4L,3.5,,"I feel like the 2010s were filled with these movies that had “different” takes on the idea of “love”. Some combined genres with romance, but ultimately, they all felt like they were adapted from a book. Not that I hated them, I binge watched a lot of them shamelessly. Shout out “Perks of Being a Wallflower” and “The Edge of Seventeen” for some midnight entertainment. This movie is among that echelon of movies. “Stuck In Love” is a charming portrayal on the different types of love. One who’s cynical and scared to love, one who’s never been in love but dives in headfirst, and one who’s been and is waiting for a love that’s not coming back. And the actors really sell on these points, Greg Kinnear, Lily Collins, and Nat Wolff bringing that yearning and fear to screen in masterful fashion. Is the story a little rushed? Yes. The multiple storylines make it difficult to explore the minor characters barring some quick scenes for depth. I also feel that the ending doesn’t work with the overall theme. But overall, it’s a heartfelt movie that depicts love at its different stages and with different people. Also weirdly makes writing seem like a genetic thing because you’re telling me that both of his kids end up publishing books just like him but in high school? Because if so, I wanna read what they’re writing. A bunch of Christopher Paolini wanna-bes in this movie.",,2025-01-04
2025-01-05,Filth,2013,https://boxd.it/8k2yvl,4.5,,"This movie is the best anti-drug movie I’ve ever seen. James McAvoy either lights a cigarette, snorts cocaine, or does other drug stuff that I won’t mention quite literally every other scene. And on the spectrum of explicit content in the movie, that’s certainly the less graphic side of it. “Filth” is a visceral character study of a homophobic, sexist, racist, transphobic, bigoted (fill in other synonyms), misanthropic man who’s slowly losing his mind. And I don’t want to say that the ending is satisfying or cathartic, but it is. For ninety minutes, Bruce Robertson, depicted by an insane James McAvoy, engages in depraved behavior (phrased in the least extreme way possible) and commits acts of debauchery and crimes against the people who respect him, and as we watch, we surprisingly find ourselves at the end empathizing for this character. It’s an unpleasant and stressful film that relies on the gruesome images to craft an intensely hateable character, but is also admirable for how they can still squeeze an immense amount of empathy for such a character by the end. McAvoy’s phenomenal performance as Robertson really sells the character as this mentally unstable man despite the hatred he exudes. This movie's bleak and depressing tone, combined with its brutal depiction of life, makes it hard to embrace its subject matter. And yet, it excels. Here is a terrible human being and we’re looking for just the smallest glimmer of a happy ending. Spoilers, it isn’t.",,2025-01-04

This is a hilarious action-comedy with an all-star cast and they all hit it out of the park! While Melissa McCarthy is an amazing lead, Jason Statham was my favorite throughout this film. He subverts his usual roles of “tough guy that never gets hurt” for an idiot and it’s amazing. Hysterical and surprisingly sincere, “Spy” is a blast from beginning to end.",,2025-01-05

But okay movie? It’s very much like the Percy Jackson adaptation, while a wholly terrible adaptation, it still serves as an alright movie, albeit with some inexplicable plot holes. And inexplicable by a very large margin. Cause we’re gonna conveniently throw all the time travel/loop rules out the window for the sake of love and that’s ignoring the fact that this kid’s got parents and a grandpa. But for all its worth, I enjoyed Eva Green as Miss Peregrine and Samuel L. Jackson as Barron, on the other hand, Asa Butterfield was quite wooden as a character. The fantasy horror tone Director Tim Burton was going for only worked for about five minutes after they revealed the Slender-Man-looking monsters and then they chose to give a flashback. It’s unfortunate that given a world so weird and fantastical, they did very little with it besides break a few laws of physics. Again, a terrible film adaptation and only slightly better as a movie.

2025-01-07,Chronicle,2012,https://boxd.it/8m9hJd,4,,"Dane DeHaan has been typecast as the villain or the broken man/kid/friend that ends up being evil and rightfully so, he’s always great when he’s dark and brooding for some odd reason. And in this movie, he’s probably at his darkest out of any movie he’s been in and that’s including his stint as the Green Goblin. “Chronicle” is a found-footage film about these high schoolers who get powers and what they do with it. And it’s a better “superhero” origin film than anything Marvel or DC has put on screen. With not a single spandex suit or waving cape in sight, “Chronicle” takes the superhero tropes that we know and flips it on its head. Because let’s be honest, if any of us got powers, our first thought isn’t how we can help society (bless Peter Parker for being Spider Man) but what fun we can have with it. And the found footage style sells on this. The use of different cameras to show their point of view feels visceral and raw, like the audience is really there. We watch as they do pranks and test out their powers in junkyards and while other movies never quite get the feeling of superhuman powers right (That includes every Spiderman film that didn’t star Andrew Garfield), you can really feel yourself flying in this film. But the story elevates this movie above other superhero movies. As much as we all believe in the hope that Marvel and DC heroes exude in the core of their stories, sometimes we just want to see what superpowers would really do in a society that isn’t nearly as binary as comics depicts. Dehaan’s portrayal of Andrew isn’t just about his discovery of powers but also his need to capture everything on a camera for what he perceives as a barrier from the outside world. His story, dark and broken, adds emotional weight to the idea that neither heroes or villains are born to be what they are. Michael B. Jordan’s Steve and Alex Russell’s Matt are terrific foils to Dehaan’s Andrew, showcasing their originally similar but eventually vastly different ideas to their powers. In the end, this isn’t just a superhero story. It’s a human one. It’s a character study on the corrupting influence of power and how heroes and villains aren’t made or born, but forged by their choices, circumstances, and environment.

2025-01-08,Be Kind Rewind,2008,https://boxd.it/8mV2Lz,4,,"I think it’s important to mention that Jack Black getting magnetized via throwing a grappling hook at a power station and having magnetic pee is a significant plot point in this story and if you can’t enjoy that scene in your head, then you can’t enjoy the best cinema has to offer. “Be Kind Rewind” is a weird but heartfelt love letter to filmmaking, starring Mos Def and Jack Black. A Michael Gondry film at its finest (even despite having “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” in his filmography), it takes a fantastical premise and delivers a sincere and comedic tribute to the art of filmmaking and the community behind it. I mean what better way to pay homage to some of the greatest films in history than watching Jack Black and Mos Def commit to a live action Lion King remake via paper mache or act out an essential Rush Hour 2 scene at a playground park with kids. It’s an appreciation for the artistry behind films. How else would I learn to film a night scene during the day without a photocopy of my face and a negative button on the camera. The chemistry between Black and Def is comforting, evoking the spirit of those amateur filmmakers at the young age of eight running around with a camcorder and making their own “films” to watch in their living room. It’s a comfort film that talks about gentrification, jazz, and the death of VHS while sending out a love letter to filmmakers everywhere and the communities behind them. ",,2025-01-07
2025-01-10,Sicario,2015,https://boxd.it/8oM39B,4.5,,"There’s no shortage of gloom or misery when it comes to crime and this movie remains the perfect depiction of it. Because when the argument of whether the ends justify the means comes into play, then there are no heroes in the story, no matter what good is justified. “Sicario”, directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Taylor Sheridan, follows a task force’s high stakes mission to dismantle a drug cartel from the perspective of a newly hired agent. Cinematographer Roger Deakins and writer Taylor Sheridan masterfully capture the beauty and terror in the landscape throughout, blending breathtaking visuals with intense writing to evoke a pervasive sense of anxiety throughout this film. The visuals are visceral and gritty, setting the movie in realism while preserving the beautiful scenery in the background. The story drives the film, questioning the morals and ethics of our characters while illustrating no other choices could be taken. Intense and amoralistic, this movie sets Emily Blunt as an unwilling watcher and protagonist to the events that follow and by leaving her as a character without agency, crafts a sense of helplessness that is unrelieved in the two hours this movie runs. Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro deliver acting masterclasses, depicting soldiers driven by hunger but lacking remorse for their actions. The score of the film adheres to the intensity and anxiety the film evokes and aids in the most suspenseful scenes. It’s a terrifying yet irresistible depiction of the drug war, raising questions of morality and principles–questions that linger long after the credits roll.

2025-01-13,Tomorrowland,2015,https://boxd.it/8skaPT,2.5,Yes,"I want to like this movie. It has an amazing world that I’d love to explore, an inspirational message (if not a little depressing), an original premise, and beautiful action sequences. But visuals can only carry a movie so far, especially when the aforementioned world is barely seen and the inspirational message is crammed into a monologue in the final act. That’s not to say it’s a bad movie though. It’s entertaining with great action sequences, solid comedic chops, and honestly impressive CGI. But for what’s supposed to be an inspirational message-driven film, “Tomorrowland” fails to convey its poignant message regardless of who’s watching. And I love the message. The idea that “For the world to be a better place, there must be dreamers and people who hope” is a beautiful and idealistic moral that should resonate within this movie, but fails to do so. And that’s not even considering the amazing premise that our supposed villain played by Hugh Laurie stood on: For the world to change, people must see what destruction the world could turn into. Both sides are looking for the same thing, but coming to different conclusions to get there, and yet the worst thing this movie could do, they did by condensing that theme and premise into a thirty second monologue by Hugh Laurie (even if it was well acted). There’s so much potential for this movie from worldbuilding to story structure. A world where the future is made by the brightest minds on Earth and aren’t limited by anything but their own creativity is a world full of stories and possibilities. Heck, they could’ve written something about the duality of Laurie’s character and George Clooney’s character. Despite the failure of the story, I enjoyed what the actors brought to screen. Britt Robertson was funny and was great as this know-it-all protagonist who’s also the “chosen one” for some reason. George Clooney was Clooney and it worked. Raffey Cassidy was hilarious as a robot and acted up to the levels of her costars. But no matter how entertaining this movie is, it nags at me what they could’ve done with it. For a movie that’s about unlocking humanity’s potential for a brighter future, this film ironically fails to unlock its own.",,2025-01-12

Hell, Timothy Olyphant and Ben Schwartz have maybe a paragraph worth of lines combined. That being said, I have to wonder how much was cut and left on the editing room floor because I remember the trailer containing a lot more jokes than this. But nonetheless, with what it had, it worked alright. Jason Bateman is charming as our depressed protagonist and the dysfunctional family dynamic could not have been better casted. I recently discovered Adam Driver plays a surprisingly charming asshole and it works just fine in this movie too. While comedic, the story fails to develop the characters beyond simple exposition, leaving an unsteady pace and skeletal story in its wake. Timothy Olyphant and Tina Fey’s storyline felt like it was filmed and then cut in the editing room. The same could be said with Kathryn Hahn and Corey Stoll’s character development. I will say that I laughed a lot though.

I mean it’s a parody of Spiderman. But I can’t lie, I laughed way too much to call it bad. Leslie Nielsen has been and will always be a comedy icon and is a gift in this film. Unironically better than a large portion of superhero movies today, the movie takes the superhero tropes we all know and are bored of and crafts laughs out of it. How they got the licensing to show Wolverine or Johnny Storm is beyond me, but hilarious. Yes, it’s low-brow humor from farts to dick jokes, but it’s funny. And out of a parody, it’s all I expect and got in spades. Look, if I had to choose between “Venom” and this movie, I'd take this movie any day of the week.

Not a single word spoken or a human seen, yet I felt like I understood every bark, caw, meow, and whatever sounds the capybara and lemur made throughout the movie. And because of that, this film perfectly embodies the idea of “show, don’t tell”. To characterize each of these animals in such a unique fashion with only the art on screen demonstrates mastery in storytelling and animation. The cat is an isolated and cautious creature, but its struggle to survive leads it to come out of its shell for animals it would’ve run from in the beginning. The capybara sleeps half its day away and spends the other half saving animals on this boat just because it feels like it. The bird is caring yet cold, and it’s exiled from its flock and finds solace in this motley crew on a boat. There’s more animals and each has character arcs and are understandable just from the delightful animation on screen. And from something that looks like a cinematic out of a video game, it is stunningly beautiful. Entirely immersive, “Flow” makes the audience feel like they are along for the ride too, following each of these animals in this foreign world. And in an era of filmmaking where animals are anthropomorphized more times than not, this film is a good change of pace. Because as much as I enjoy Disney’s Zootopia where animals are basically people, I loved “Flow” for its depiction of essentially smart animals that acted like animals but had just the slightest bit of humanity to show storylines and narrative arcs. And this film builds a world filled with large cat statues and abandoned architectural landscapes with not a word said, and yet, is still so immersive with just its visuals alone. What I would give for an open-world game to explore this land. Without a single line of dialogue, “Flow” presents an immersive visual masterpiece that captures friendship, tenacity, and the struggle for survival, all told through the eyes of its animal protagonists.

And that’s not to say that it also isn’t a piece of art. With a hilarious script and unbeatable chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, it’s an entertaining fanfare that builds an intricate rich world filled with aliens and suited agents in prime New York City. And it holds up in 2025 with excellent practical effects and timeless comedy. The buddy-cop genre with the arrogant rookie and wise old-timer is an overused trope, but with Smith and Jones in an alien-filled Earth, it fits as seamlessly as the suits they wear. Still a go-to Halloween costume for me, “Men in Black” is a classic movie that has it all: comedy, action, aliens, and an Oscar-worthy Vincent D’Onofrio performance.",,2025-01-15

Nor did I think I would be getting a sex ed lesson from Jason Sudeikis in this movie. In a raunchier but still charming fashion similar to that of “When Harry Met Sally”, “Sleeping With Other People” is about two friends who converse with each other as they deal with love on their own wandering paths in New York City. Sure, the friends to lovers trope is one that’s as old as time, but with Jason Sudeikis and Alison Brie at the helm, it’s nonetheless charming. While it is impeccable with comedic timing, as expected with Brie and Sudeikis’ chemistry, it is also quite honest about the more raw intimate parts of love. Very honest. Two essentially broken adults who have various issues within their lives meet, what do you expect? It does get cheesy in the finale, but that’s to be expected with every romcom. But I will say, there’s no way she studied for the MCAT in one scene and then got into Michigan Med School in the next, only to drop out in the scene after. So yes, while this is essentially an underrated and more unrestrained (to say the least) version of “When Harry Met Sally”, the movie ambitiously tries to cover the more physical side of a relationship, tugging at the heartstrings.

2025-01-17,Wristcutters: A Love Story,2006,https://boxd.it/8vlgiZ,4,,"Setting up a world that’s “the same, just a little worse” and then introducing a car that has a black hole underneath a seat so you lose anything that’s dropped under there is one of the greatest plot devices I’ve ever seen. In a weirdly comforting fashion, this movie takes us on this road trip through purgatory for people who committed suicide. Honest about suicide and the futility of life, it somehow reflects on humanity while weaving a beautiful love story. This whole movie, we watch this group of depressed fellows meet more depressed fellows, introductions edited in of their choice of death, and no smiles are shared anytime. So when our protagonist finally smiles in the end, the blandness of purgatory turning into color, that feeling of hope is infectious. Is it a weird movie? Absolutely, but it’s weirdly funny and comforting in all the best ways. ",,2025-01-16

Glen Powell and Zoey Duetch are adorable and lead this comedic scheme to set up their bosses together, hilariously played by Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu. The leads excellently deliver on comedic timing and lovely charm throughout.

For “Airplane”, a jokes-per-second or jokes-per-scene measure would put it solidly in first place ahead of all the comedies that I’ve watched in my life (zero proof, but I can assume). This film is comedy at its purest. A genre that’s an expansive collection of subgenres from dark humor to slapstick, most movies tend to choose one and stick with it, rarely merging a couple. This movie is the first I’ve seen that uses them all, and does it well. Every scene, with at least one visual gag, a bit of slapstick humor, and a dark joke in the next line, guarantees a laugh, no matter what. And yes, a part of me wants to say that it is cheating a bit because if one type of humor doesn’t work, there’s about four different ones in the next thirty seconds that are bound to garner a laugh, but I can’t lie when I say that all of the scenes earned a smile in the very least from me. A smart type of comedy that doesn’t let up in its ninety minute runtime and has infinite replayability, it’s an excellent movie to turn to for pure laughter.

2025-01-22,Lost in Translation,2003,https://boxd.it/8zonxJ,3.5,,"I love films that have no other purpose than to emit a certain atmosphere or vibe. Sure, most don’t have a plot to follow, much less a character arc, but these movies craft this environment that feels tangible through our eyes and ears. “Lost in Translation” is very much in this bracket of movies, if not the quintessential choice. And I can see why! The air of loneliness in this film is pervasive and isolating, yet oddly beautiful. Sofia Coppola masterfully captures the beauty in this feeling and atmosphere. The snapshots of Scarlett Johannson exploring Japan on her own and the scenes of Bill Murray alone at the bar are cathartic and empathetic. Then they meet. Two people, finding themselves lost and alone in a crowded room, seek solace in one another. In hindsight, the beauty of it should be obvious. But I couldn’t really see it. The pacing of the relationship feels rushed and artificial. While the emotional chemistry was there, the lack of a plot leaves much of the relationship off-screen. And it’s also just less interesting than the rest of the film. Murray finds himself alone and he spends it wandering the hotel. Johannson is left alone and she goes out to explore the city and beyond. The disparity in how they react to their loneliness feels far more interesting than the relationship they built with one another. Still, Coppola excellently crafts an atmosphere and environment that evokes feelings of longing and loneliness, something that everyone has felt before. “Lost in Translation” doesn’t have a plot. It doesn’t have much of a story, actually. But it does communicate how it feels to be alone even if you’re in a crowd. And that’s all it really needs to do.

Through dazzling visuals, a thought-provoking script, and a world-class performance by Joaquin Phoenix, “Her” delves into the possibilities of the future and explores the beauty of human connections through technology. And despite it being a decade old, it’s more relevant than ever as new chatbots become available in this age of AI. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a masterful and subtle performance as an introverted man who’s learning what it means to love. From tears of sorrow to joyful laughter, Phoenix disappears into a man who falls in love with an OS who’s spectacularly voiced by Scarlett Johannson. And the script expertly explores this dynamic between man and machine. It debates sentience and love and brings up questions of what it means to stop loving someone and to begin to. All in tune with the picture-perfect world that the visuals convey. Warm colors and spectacular buildings fill the screen, captured in a not-to-distant futuristic way by the excellent cinematography. It depicts life at its best, filled with love. Ultimately, this film is a contemplative and poetic reflection about love, humanity, and the connections that define us. And for a movie from 2013, it’s a somewhat prophetic vision of a future where technology becomes inseparably intertwined in our lives. ",,2025-01-24

No, that strained relationship does not get fixed nor does he quit his job as an actor or anything by the end of the movie. But as an audience, we live vicariously through this actor as he moves from place to place, indulging in vices purely out of boredom and trying to keep his relationship with his daughter unaffected by it all. While not filled with heavy moments, it’s surprisingly warm at times and depressing at others. It’s a film driven by perspective, embracing Coppola’s signature style.",,2025-01-25

But the ones that do are surprisingly well-made and incredibly entertaining. Visceral and bloody, “Green Room” represents not only this niche category, but the thriller genre to a maximum, barring the tropes that plague other movies in its bracket. Not needlessly bloody just to be gory. No stupid decisions from the main characters that builds more comedy than tension. It’s a nerve-wracking movie that builds up suspense with every second, not letting off the gas. And unsurprisingly, smart villains make for scary movies.

I had bigger gripes with the story, but it certainly led for a few laughs after the movie ended before the slew of complaints. I wanted to like this movie, but the MCU’s attempt to transition into the next chapter has been lackluster in these past few movies, this one being the newest addition. Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, and Danny Ramirez act their best with a less than stellar script. And the script was well below standard. The introduction felt like a rushed fifteen-minute presentation that held up the film on scaffolding that by no means provided the needed amount of exposition. Combined with hazy logic, the movie failed to capitalize on the Marvel formula: comedy and action. Despite a more interesting, grounded, and political take on the superhero genre, the movie found itself muddled underneath bland visuals and faulty logic.

All scenes outside of the building are seen through the eyes of their audience, through the television screen on the news. We’re dragged back into the 1930s with this perspective and just like them, we’re hungry for updates no matter the extent they had to go to get them.

Specifically when we walked in to find the place packed with senior citizens who were not my first pick at the typical demographic for this movie. But if anything, they may have enjoyed it more than I did from the myriad of laughs throughout the film. Part “Three Stooges” and part “Lost in Translation”, “Anora” explores the tenacity of one girl, her dreams, as well as the mental strength of the henchmen tasked with bringing her in. It can be tearfully hilarious in one scene and devastatingly sad the next, but the character study of what Anora would do to believe in love is nothing short of breathtaking and in some ways, inspiring. The visuals feel like something almost found-footage-like but also artfully crafted where we could go down one street chasing Anora with a swinging camera, only to turn a corner and see the most beautiful sunset on a pier with the dark shadow of Anora getting smaller as she gets further away. Could it have been shorter? There were definitely some parts where I think snippets could’ve been cut off. But overall, it’s an intensely beautiful movie that displays a need for love at its brightest and its darkest, creating laughs from the most random moments and tears in the next from the most mundane scenes.

It has the beauty of a standard Studio Ghibli film but the emotional weight of even the most depressing war movies and the combination really is hauntingly beautiful.

Life tends to be more subtle with the choices we make and the regrets we are burdened with. Silently, we mourn the choices we wish we made while wistfully smiling at the results we have today, while wondering “what if?” “Past Lives” movie is that “what if” movie. Director and writer Celine Song weaves this soulful tale of choices, regrets, heartbreaks, and romances out of beautiful static shots of New York and the acting prowess of Greta Lee, Teo Yoo, and John Magaro. An intensely meditative movie, “Past Lives” is a quiet film, but not a hollow one. More is said in the silence between the glances of one another than the words expressed. The story structure and cinematography work hand-in-hand to tell a story that is both depressing yet profoundly human. It doesn’t offer fantasy, but rather truth. And in a genre where the audience is taught to root for the star-crossed lovers every time, “Past Lives” reminds us that love is more than just what happens in the end. It lives in the series of moments, memories, and actions between what could be and what is. ",,2025-04-11

Because the pining that Dex, depicted charismatically by Jim Sturgess, is Jane-Austen-esque in so many ways. “One Day” is a love story told in years. We watch as these two drastically different people grow apart and then together, and then apart again, only to get back together. And it’s tangibly maddening watching Dex deny his emotions again and again only to come back to Emma Morley, beautifully played by Anne Hathaway. Hathaway and Sturgess teach a masterclass in chemistry on the screen even when they’re in two different cities on a phone call with the screen cutting between each one like a duel of words. Cheesiness bleeds from the screen with each conversation and while you can’t help but groan and drown in it, it is heartwarming and tear jerking in the best way possible. On a slight note, the ending is dumbfounding to say the least, but well worth the journey. Plus it’s a travel bug movie for sure.",,2025-04-13

The dead body starts farting and because it was farting, the stranded guy decided to use the dead body as a farting motorboat to the next island. That statement has only worked once. And that was before I watched it in the first place and only because I didn’t know what the rest of the movie was about. I was expecting some weird gruesome movie from the TikTok clips, and I wasn’t far off. But to my surprise, it also might be the funniest movie I have ever seen. It’s not the physical comedy, witty dialogue type of funny that I was used to. It’s this antithetical gruesome humor and over the top dark jokes that builds this world so hilariously, I learned life lessons from this movie. Paul Dano livens up the screen despite his aloofness and cowardly nature. Daniel Radcliffe plays a dead guy so well I forgot he was Harry Potter after they displayed that his mouth was a fountain. The moment I saw the first whip pan from the camera, I could see where “Everything Everywhere All At Once” got its kinetic style from. The editing and cinematography bring energy to every scene from Radcliffe’s farting to his rocket powered gut. But above all else, the story is perfect. We’re taken on this weird formative journey where this depressed man learns how to live life from this dead body. And hilariously, so do we. Life’s about the little moments and Radcliffe in his zombie-like glory was the perfect teacher. Highly recommend, sober, high, and/or drunk.

It portrays families of all walks of life, the dreams that they have, the failures they overcome, and the life they live. And families aren’t perfect. Some, despite what every Disney movie might say, aren’t the warm blanket that’ll comfort you when times get tough. Some are, but they aren’t perfect. And the story knows that. We’re not watching this with rose-colored lenses and that’s okay. The love stories they tell span from love at first sight to arranged marriage and it doesn’t shy away from the hardships in life whether that be heartbreak or death. The story isn’t always comforting, but then neither is life. The actors and actresses seem inseparable from their characters, conveying those emotions that we’ve felt in our lives, whether that be love, happiness, anger, or sadness perfectly. The editing and cinematography capture the show in these series of vignettes that accentuate life at its brightest and lowest moments. It’s a perfect adaptation of life and as much as I don’t want to see reality when I’m watching a show or a movie, I can’t help but find myself being hopeful at the prospects of my future, just like they did in the show.

Jake Gyllenhaal does his best impression/combination of Leo Dicaprio from “The Wolf of Wall Street” and Ryan Gosling from “The Notebook”. Josh Gad somehow scarred me with his performance, but that might be more on the story’s fault than his. This movie is quite liberal with the “comedy” tag but if anything, it hits the romance tag as hard as possible while advertising drugs at the same time, so I guess it works. Is the story weird? Absolutely, I’m so confused with the whole pharmaceutical rep storyline and Gad’s role in this movie. I could’ve lived without seeing both because the whole pharmaceutical role could’ve been replaced by any other job profession that lands Gyllenhaal in the hospital to meet Hathaway’s character, who by the way is surprisingly well-rounded, but I fully believe that they were sponsored by drug companies to advertise. Josh Gad plays this disgusting character who’s only memorable act is “yanking it” to his brother’s sex tape, so take that how you will.

In this weird theological comedy adventure, director Kevin Smith takes an all-star cast (including himself) and builds a world of resentful angels, skeptical believers, and ridiculous cardinals that is the quintessential religious movie. When the movie started off by rebranding Catholicism with a cartoon Christ that looks like it belongs in a comic book store, I knew I was in for some fun, I just didn’t expect to get a theology lesson as well. And in a fun non-pastor, non-sermon type of way too. The script, between the horny dick jokes and crass humor, is a surprisingly fluid and emotionally resonant piece that the actors fully commit to. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck act their asses off discussing the horrors of modern society in reference to the Bible. Alan Rickman showing his crotchless bottom like a Ken Doll while arguing what it means to have faith is something that shouldn’t work, but does. Chris Rock argues over a cheeseburger meal what it means to discern morality in the Bible and the issues with idolization and belief structures in religion. Because wrapped up in the comedy and drama of this movie is a philosophical and theological discussion on what it means to believe and have faith.

And in this political mockumentary, the military takes a beating from the actor of “The Princess Pride”. And it’s incredibly well done with exploding tanks, car chases, and secret meetings. That makes it sound a tad more Mission Impossible-esque than it really is, but that’s just to say that there’s a surprising amount of action sequences for what I believe to be a television film. It's a sardonic and comedic take on a very real political story (allegedly) and it excels at mocking the bureaucracy. The script is sharp witted and hilarious, the actors taking it in stride. That guy from Frasier is awesome as the general. Viola Davis makes an appearance surprisingly! And the guy from “The Princess Bride” is perfect as the confused everyman looking at the mudpile that is bureaucracy. A part of me wants to believe that it’s actually a documentary because the military creating a department just for buying sheep out of pettiness is nothing short of hilarious to me. ",,2025-05-31
2025-06-05,"The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse",2022,https://boxd.it/9UghHz,4,,"In this Winnie-the-pooh-esque story of a boy lost in the woods, I have no idea what was going on. Was there some symbolism somewhere? There could be, I could not tell. Was there a story? Yes, a boy gets lost in the woods and gets out. Actually, scratch that, I’m not actually sure what that ending was. All I know is that Pegasus shows up and that scene was beautiful. Evidently, this is a very “vibes” based movie where nothing really happens and simultaneously, so much happens and is said. But despite its ambiguity, it is undeniably beautiful. Hand drawn animation with a poetic script (and I mean poetry like Robert Frost decided to write a movie script), it’s a soulful movie that doesn’t overstay its welcome, and for a movie set in a winter storm, it’s very warm at its core.

2025-06-05,Me Before You,2016,https://boxd.it/9UgjpH,3.5,,"I can see why this got edited a million different ways on Tiktok and Youtube. This movie is the epitome of “sappy movie”. There’s only room for two emotions in this movie: love and sadness. And of course, they go hand in hand. Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke have incredible chemistry and drag the rather skeletal script into peak sappiness levels with their performance. Their rapport and love for one another radiates off the screen, hitting our hearts with the sting of freshly cut onions. A friend of mine said “If you don’t shed at least a tear for this movie, you’re cold and callous.”

2025-06-05,The Personal History of David Copperfield,2019,https://boxd.it/9Ugkqh,4,,"I’m realizing that despite the fact that I have read (read: “been forced to read”) many of the Charles Dickens stories throughout the years, I have seen very few reach the movie screen besides the one or two. This is how a proper Dickens story should be adapted, the British-ness and levity of it front and center, the social commentary, the vein that keeps the story running just under it. Of course, the characters are the most important of any Dickens story. With a diverse range of characters and an even more varied group of actors, they brought those characters to life. Peter Capaldi as the wily Mr. Micawber lightens up the screen no matter what state of misfortune he’s in. Hugh Laurie depicts the eccentric Mr. Dick perfectly with just the right touch of whimsy. Tilda Swinton as heiress to the Trotwood name is delightfully unhinged, embracing both the aristocratic pride and gleeful chaos. As our titular character David Copperfield, Dev Patel is the star of the movie, playing the perfect British everyman going from lowly factory worker to rich writer. The story, quaint and comforting, unfolds like a three act play, complete with motifs, character arcs, and recurring characters. The cinematography is vibrant and perfect for a Dickens adaptation, jolly in color palette and tone with a hint of theatrical flair. It’s a comfort movie in its most British form, which I guess is the best compliment to a Charles Dickens adaptation as it can get.

2025-06-05,Scavengers Reign,2023,https://boxd.it/9UgOEj,5,,"Worldbuilding is an art by itself. To describe it without over-expounding it, to immerse an audience without boring them, these are traits that have to be balanced for the best effect on those watching. Scavengers Reign immerses the audience in this strange but beautiful world and visualizes all of it in this hauntingly picturesque way. The premise of stranded survivors on an unknown planet isn’t new, but worldbuilding in sci fi has never seen anything like this. The world is bright with light and covered in this highlighter color palette but can also be the deepest of blacks and convey this nightmarish tone. The animation is soft and well done, each scene a different painting with different colors and tone.The story allows the characters to explore this world and with them, us. We see the curious yet scary interactions that they have with this strange world and we understand a little more about it too with each step they take. In this world, is this beautiful story that segmented between different survivors and their various stories. The characters have depth and we grow to understand them too just as we understand the strange world around them. The sound design and the score throughout is contemplative and somber. Light on the instruments but heavy with dynamics, it was a must add for my playlists. Overall, just an incredibly well made series. I for one have wishful thinking that besides season two, I hope that whoever designed this world goes into video game design and crafts an open-world game for me to explore. This is science fiction at its purest and its best and I would not have it any other way.

2025-06-09,Pacific Rim,2013,https://boxd.it/9Wve0P,4,,"As far as I’m aware, prime cinema is giant robots fighting giant monsters and this movie fits the bill perfectly. Outside of the ungodly soundtrack, peak Guillermo Del Toro worldbuilding, amazing CGI (that holds up a decade later which is either telling of current films or just this movie), and awesome action sequences, there isn’t much else that is needed. Charlie Hunnam plays a great action hero, Idris Elba, the stoic commander. Peak cinema of all things considered.",,2025-06-07
2025-06-11,Ted 2,2015,https://boxd.it/9XZiQJ,3,,"I’m wondering if redoing the Jurassic Park scene with a talking teddy bear and a field of marijuana infringes on copyright, but I’m thankful it didn’t because that was an amazing scene. Look, this movie is chalkful of cameos, curses, and weed. Was I expecting much else from an R-rated teddy bear, no. So it hits all the marks I expected, plus Amanda Seyfried is lowkey good at the stoner lawyer role, if that’s a thing.",,2025-06-09
2025-06-11,The Hangover,2009,https://boxd.it/9XZqzB,3.5,,"Forget the “Ocean’s 11” series or “Swingers”. I think this is the iconic “Las Vegas” movie. Because in what other way could you best encapsulate “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas” than this movie? Four dudes go to Vegas for a bachelor party, what happens? Well for starters, three wake up and they certainly don’t know and neither do we, at least up until we watch the end credits (I miss end credits where cut scenes or extra clips are shown) It’s a tight movie that has no scenes of boredom and a hilarious story that brings out the best of the actors. Bradley Cooper, surprisingly funny, Ed Helms, classically funny, Zach Galifianakis, weird funny. All in all, “The Hangover” isn’t just the definitive “Las Vegas” movie, it’s a masterpiece in comedic storytelling, taking unfiltered chaos and turning it into idiotic brilliance. No filler, no slow moments, just three dudes trying to figure out what happened on an unforgettable Vegas night. ",,2025-06-10
